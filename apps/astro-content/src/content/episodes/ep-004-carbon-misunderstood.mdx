longDescription: |
  When farmers think about inputs, they think nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium — the NPK on every fertilizer bag. But the element that matters most is the one almost nobody talks about: carbon.

  In this episode, Mike Usry makes the case that carbon is the single most important element in agriculture. It's the backbone of organic matter, the fuel for soil microbes, and the key to building soil that sustains itself. Yet modern farming practices have systematically depleted carbon from our soils for decades.

  Mike explains what carbon actually does in the soil, why it's been ignored, and how adding it back is the highest-leverage move any grower can make.

## What You'll Learn

Carbon isn't just for climate conversations — it's the foundation of everything happening in your soil. In this episode, Mike explains:

- **Why carbon is overlooked** in favor of NPK
- **What carbon actually does** — feeding microbes, building structure, retaining water
- **How modern farming depleted** soil carbon over decades
- **Carbon sequestration** — what it means practically for growers
- **The carbon-first approach** to soil management

## Key Takeaways

### Carbon Is the Foundation
Every living thing is built on carbon. In soil, carbon is the energy source that drives the entire microbial ecosystem. Without adequate carbon, nothing else works — not your fertilizer, not your microbes, not your water retention.

### We've Been Mining Our Carbon
Decades of tillage, monocropping, and synthetic-only programs have systematically removed carbon from agricultural soils. We've been withdrawing from the carbon bank without making deposits.

### Adding Carbon Is High-Leverage
Dollar for dollar, adding carbon to your soil (through humates, compost, or cover crops) delivers more long-term return than any other single input. It's the multiplier that makes everything else work better.

## Who This Episode Is For

- **Commercial farmers** looking to improve soil health sustainably
- **Turf managers** wanting to build resilient, self-sustaining turf
- **Sustainability-minded growers** interested in carbon sequestration
- **Anyone curious** about why some soils thrive and others struggle
