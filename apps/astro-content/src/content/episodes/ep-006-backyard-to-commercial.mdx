longDescription: |
  The science of soil health doesn't change with scale — but the logistics, economics, and implementation absolutely do. What works for a homeowner's quarter-acre lawn looks very different when applied to a commercial poultry operation or a large-scale farm.

  In this episode, Mike Usry bridges the gap between backyard and commercial soil health. Building on the foundations laid in previous episodes, he explains how commercial growers can implement the same biology-first principles at scale — and why the economics actually favor this approach as operations get larger.

  From application methods to cost-per-acre analysis, this episode gives commercial growers the practical framework to make soil conditioning work in their operation.

## What You'll Learn

Scaling soil health isn't about doing the same thing on more acres — it's about adapting principles to commercial realities. In this episode, Mike explains:

- **Why the science scales** but the methods change
- **Commercial application methods** — spraying, injection, fertigation
- **Cost-per-acre economics** that make the business case
- **Poultry-specific** soil and litter health connections
- **How to measure ROI** on soil health investments
- **A practical framework** for getting started at scale

## Key Takeaways

### The Economics Improve at Scale
Soil conditioning is actually more cost-effective at commercial scale. Per-acre costs drop, and the compounding benefits — reduced input needs, better yields, less disease pressure — have a larger financial impact.

### Start With Your Worst Acres
Don't try to convert your entire operation at once. Start with your lowest-performing fields or houses, implement a biology-first program, and let the results make the case for expansion.

### Poultry and Soil Are Connected
For commercial poultry growers, litter health and soil health are directly connected. Healthy microbial populations in litter reduce ammonia, improve bird health, and ultimately improve the soil when litter is land-applied.

## Who This Episode Is For

- **Commercial poultry growers** looking to improve litter and soil health
- **Row crop farmers** considering a soil biology program
- **Farm managers** evaluating the economics of soil conditioning
- **Turf professionals** scaling from residential to commercial clients
