Our Tips and Tricks segments are among our viewers' favorite Poultry Biosecurity videos. We love sharing great farmer-to-farmer advice, so Allen is back with our third edition of Tips and Tricks for Your Poultry Farm.

The following four tips are all from growers who submitted their advice with photos and videos. We want to thank these growers for their work in feeding our country and helping others do the same!

## Tip #1: Surprising Screen in Water Flow Regulators

This first tip is from an Alabama grower. Did you know that in the regulator that controls water flow into your poultry house, there is usually a mesh screen? As you can see in his photo, this screen can catch debris like PVC shavings. If you suspect an issue with your water flow, you may want to check the screen in your regulator to see if it may be clogged.

## Tip #2: DIY Magnets

Farmers in both North Carolina and South Carolina submitted this tip. They made custom magnets to put on their feed bins. These magnets communicate to their drivers what should go where. [Magnetsonthecheap.com](https://www.magnetsonthecheap.com/ "Magnets on the Cheap") is one good resource to make some magnets for your farm. This is an easy, inexpensive way to communicate to your truck drivers! 

## Tip #3: Protect your Plugs

A grower in North Carolina found a really clever way to recycle plastic soda bottles. Cut the bottle in half, string your cords through and run the bottle along the cord until you reach the plug. Situate the plug inside the bottle, and it will be protected from water and debris!

## Tip #4: An Extra Set of Eyes

A South Carolina poultry farmer has a tip on how to get an extra set of eyes for tasks like filling up trucks. This grower has a solar powered video recorder on the edge of his stack house. When he's filling up a truck with litter, he and the driver can look at live monitoring of the truck as it fills. This way, they can quickly know how and when to move the truck as it fills.
