About two years ago, Sarah was a farm intern at Southland Organics. She brought our greenhouse and fields to life. When she graduated from the University of Georgia in 2019, Sarah went to serve as a missionary in Nicaragua.

Since December 2021, we've been lucky enough to have Sarah back in the office. She's been improving our warehouse operations and preparing our garden, fields and greenhouse for the growing season. In late March, she'll be going back to Nicaragua.

We are so proud of Sarah and what she does to share the gospel though real-work agricultural skills. Southland Organics has been a sponsor of Sarah's mission for the past 2 years, and we're excited and honored to support her again as she returns to Nicaragua.
