Do you consider your generator the most important piece of equipment when you need it? And do you kind of forget about it—out of sight, out of mind—when you don’t? 

Poultry farmers know all too well that a power outage can wipe out entire flocks, if a generator fails. Bad storms pummel the south in the spring and summer, and being unprepared can cost you big time!

Jason Jackson shares simple, easy ways you can refresh your generators to make sure when you need them, they’re ready to serve you and your birds. 

Because generators can be set to exercise automatically each week, and we have them professionally serviced each year, it’s easy to forget about generator maintenance you, as a farmer, can do to ensure your generator is there for you when you need it. 

Jason shares that by simply sweeping off the dust in your control room and blowing off the generator with your blower, you can get rid of any heat buildup caused by dust. 

Also, check the fuel in your tanks. Be sure you have plenty to take you through the severe weather seasons without needing an emergency run. Finally, ensure you have extra fuel and air filters on hand! You don’t want to have to make a trip to the store in the middle of a power outage and lose precious time and birds. These simple backups might be all it takes to get your generator up and running when you have an emergency.
