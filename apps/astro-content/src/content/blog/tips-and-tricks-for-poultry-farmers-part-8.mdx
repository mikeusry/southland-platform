Maintenance issues on the farm rarely happen at a convenient time. Fans fail during heat waves, motors quit on weekends and small problems can quickly turn into big ones if you’re not prepared.

Recently, we spent time with Arkansas grower Jonathan Corbell, and his approach to organization and preparedness stood out immediately. His system is a great reminder that staying ahead of maintenance issues isn’t about working harder—it’s about working smarter.

## Build Task-Specific Maintenance Trays

One of the most effective practices Jonathan uses is creating dedicated trays for specific maintenance tasks. Instead of grabbing tools one by one or making multiple trips, each tray is stocked with everything needed for a particular job.

For example, during winter, a tray might include flame probe sensors, igniters and other heating components. If it’s time to work on vent doors or baffles, there’s a tray specifically prepared for that task, complete with pulleys, string and hardware. The result is less walking, fewer delays and faster fixes.

### Adjust Your Trays by Season

Seasonal changes bring different maintenance priorities, and Jonathan adjusts his trays accordingly.

In the summer, his tray includes tools and parts commonly needed for fans and motors:

-   Half-inch sockets and wrenches
    
-   Needle-nose pliers
    
-   Nut drivers
    
-   Common bolts and nuts
    
-   Pulleys and belts
    
-   Allen keys
    
-   Pre-made electrical cords
    

Having these items ready makes it easy to swap parts immediately instead of stopping work to search for supplies.

## Keep Small Parts Organized and Backed Up

Inside the well house, Jonathan keeps shelves filled with clearly organized bins of PVC fittings, bolts and nuts from half-inch to two-inch sizes. Everything has a designated place.

Most growers already own many of these parts, but the difference is knowing exactly where they are. When supplies are organized like a hardware aisle, anyone on the farm can find what they need quickly, saving time and frustration.

## Stock Spare Motors and Major Components

Another key practice is keeping spare motors and larger components on hand, including fan motors, feed motors and pumps. While these items are more expensive, having backups can prevent costly downtime.

Jonathan takes advantage of supplier discounts and appreciation days to stock up when prices are lower. Beyond cost savings, the real value is time, especially when equipment fails after hours, on weekends or during extreme weather.

## Save Time When It Matters Most

Maintenance issues don’t wait for business hours. When a fan motor fails in the middle of summer, time becomes critical. Having the right part on hand can mean the difference between a quick fix and serious losses.

Being prepared allows you to replace equipment immediately and worry about restocking later—rather than hoping birds can make it through the night.

## A Reminder Worth Repeating

These tips aren’t complicated, and many growers already know them. But as this visit showed, small changes in organization and preparation can make a big impact. Staying ready helps reduce stress, protect your birds and ultimately save money.
