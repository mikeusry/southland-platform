[Big Ole Bird](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/poultry-probiotic "Big Ole Bird") is a poultry supplement and probiotic featuring organic  
acids and biologically active carbon to strengthen poultry’s natural defense systems from within. Significant feedback from poultry farmers across the United States indicate the product’s effectiveness to increase bird health and flock weights, decrease mortality, improve feed conversion and gut health, strengthen the immune system and create better performance overall. We, at Southland Organics, believe so much in the product that we commissioned two third-party performance studies to gain scientific insight into the difference the product makes in poultry grow out.

## Summary

![Big Ole Bird Poultry Probiotic](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1642798983/Product%20Images/BOB-2.5.png)With the 2017 onset of antibiotic-free (ABF), broiler farmers and integrators have struggled with disease pressures with few options for relief. [Big Ole Bird](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/poultry-probiotic "Big Ole Bird") has shown to consistently increase performance  
in commercial broiler farms across the United States.

With the volume of field reports and  
one scientific study in 2016 affirming  
the positive impact Big Ole Bird has on poultry, it was our desire to commission an additional study in order to provide further scientific evidence of its positive effects on poultry performance.

Big Ole Bird leads to an improved feed conversion ratio, decreased mortality and increased weight gain.

## The 2016 Study Overview

The 2016 performance study tested male Cobb-Vantress chickens that were challenged with necrotic enteritis caused by Clostridium perfringens. The experimental group that was both challenged and administered [Big Ole Bird](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/poultry-probiotic "Big Ole Bird") showed a significantly better feed conversion and lower mortality than infected birds without Big Ole Bird treatment.

A summary of the results is displayed below:

## The 2018 Study

The purpose of the trial was to determine if [Big Ole Bird Poultry Probiotic](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/poultry-probiotic "Big Ole Bird") strengthens the immune systems in broilers by means of the bursa.

### Background

We noticed a pattern in comments from our poultry customers’ vets in regard to birds’ bursas, the sac-like lymphatic organ in poultry. Many vets pointed out significantly better bursa health in posted birds from farms administering Big Ole Bird in comparison to the bursas in posted birds from farms not administering Big Ole Bird. Prior to this, we knew Big Ole Bird strengthened poultry’s immune systems but had yet to determine through what specific means. The seemingly consistent pattern of healthier bursas in birds given Big Ole Bird prompted us to commission the 2018 trial, testing if bursas are, in fact, the means through which Big Ole Bird positively affects the immune systems in poultry.

### Trial Method

The trial location was a SPRG poultry house testing facility; the conditions were similar to those in commercial broiler houses.

For the trial, two separate floor pens were created at one end of a house. In each pen, 50 Ross 708 parent stock males were placed. Both pens were fed the same diet of starter feed from Day 0 through Day 21 and then grower feed from Day 21 through Day 38. One pen was used as a control with no additional supplements given. The second pen was treated with Big Ole Bird in the drinking water.

Both pens were identically topped with pine shavings and poultry litter that was previously challenged with Clostridium perfringens.

### Monitored Factors

1.  Antibody titers to a Newcastle disease vaccination as an indicator of immune response
    
2.  Body weights
    
3.  Bursa weights
    
4.  Bursa to body weight ratio (B:BW)
    
5.  Gross bursal score
    
6.  Microscopic bursal score
    

The bursa is a sac-like lymphatic organ in poultry. Similar to human bone marrow, the primary purpose of bursa is to produce antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that are produced in response to the presence of foreign substances and disease.

The bursa to body weight ratio is a standardized way of determining the level of bursa atrophy. Traditionally, a higher ratio is considered favorable and indicates less atrophy. Typically, the ratio increases in the first few weeks in meat-type birds due to stronger bursa development and growth. Past studies have indicated that the ratio begins to decrease around week 6 due to bursa stabilization and increased body weight.

### The Results

Body Weights: Body weights were measured at Day 17 and Day 38. No significant differences were seen at Day 17, but at Day 38, weights were significantly larger in the group treated with Big Ole Bird. The feed conversion ratio also improved by 7 points in the treated birds. The findings showed the following improvements in birds treated with Big Ole Bird:

#### Average Weight Gain Improvement (Day 38)

![Big Ole Bird Study Average Weight Gain Improvement](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0794/9519/files/BOB_Study_Weight_Gain.png)

On Day 38, birds treated with Big Ole Bird weighed, on average, 4.55 lb (2.06 kg). In contrast, on Day 38, the control group (not given Big Ole Bird) weighed, on average, 4.15 lb (1.88 kg). Overall, there was an average weight increase of 0.4 lb (0.18 kg).

#### Feed Conversion Ratio Improvement (Day 38)

![Big Ole Bird Study Feed Conversion Ratio Improvement](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0794/9519/files/BOB_Study_Feed_Conversion.png)

On Day 38, birds treated with Big Ole Bird had a feed conversion ratio of, on average, 1.60. In contrast, on Day 38, the control group (not given Big Ole Bird) had a feed conversion ratio of, on average, 1.67. Overall, there was an average feed conversion ratio improvement of 7 points.

#### Bursa to Body Weight Ratio

No significant differences were seen at Day 17. However, at the Day 38 measurement, the bursa weights were decreased while body weights were increased which led to an overall decreased bursa to body weight ratio in the treated group.

#### Additional Observations

The addition of Big Ole Bird did not significantly affect serologic response to the Newcastle disease vaccination. The addition of Big ole Bird did not significantly affect gross or microscopic bursal scores.
