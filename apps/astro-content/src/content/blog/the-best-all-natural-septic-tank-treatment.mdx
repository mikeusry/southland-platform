Preventing septic tank disasters starts with a great septic tank treatment. Preventive septic tank maintenance can save you loads of time, money and hassle—and all it takes is one monthly application! Check out this video to learn more about a simple way to make sure your septic tank is running smoothly.

## What to Know about Septic Tanks

![Septic tank](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1680296849/Blog%20Images/Septic_tank_yi1nkj.png)

Septic tanks are full of anaerobic bacteria, which are bacteria that hate oxygen. To protect themselves, anaerobic bacteria form a biofilm on top of the fluid. Septic tank issues begin when this biofilm reaches the drain lines going out to the field. When this happens, sludge from the biofilm tries to get out into the drain lines, which leads to a backed-up septic tank because it's not draining out.

### Septic Tank Efficiency

Many factors can affect the efficiency of a septic tank, including trees and roots growing into your field lines or possibly the water table coming up and not draining well. While external circumstances can affect a septic tank, hopefully the code inspector takes care of them prior to septic tank installation.

### **What are septic tank treatments?**

Septic tank treatments are substances that can be added to your septic tank to help boost the breakdown of human waste and toilet paper as well as prevent clogs.

## **Septic Tank Maintenance with PORT**

![Best septic treatment](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1680296849/Blog%20Images/Best_septic_treatment_r5hzzv.png)

Applying a monthly septic tank treatment is the key to maintaining a healthy septic system. [Southland Organics' PORT](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/port-septic-tank-treatment?_pos=1&_psq=port&_ss=e&_v=1.0 "PORT Septic Tank Treatment") is a powerful septic tank treatment that provides rapid waste degradation and odor control. We consider PORT to be one of the best septic tank treatments because it's powered by beneficial bacteria instead of harmful chemicals! These active bacteria work aerobically, so they address solid waste buildup to prevent septic backups. PORT efficiently and effectively breaks down human waste and clears bio-solids in septic systems. PORT also opens up clogged pipes, often adding years between having your tank pumped. How?

PORT contains an organic acid called fulvic acid, which breaks down biofilm. When the biofilm is broken down, the septic tank is able to do its job. Another key ingredient in PORT is aerobic bacteria. As the opposite of anaerobic bacteria, aerobic bacteria likes oxygen and thrives in its presence. This keeps the sludge out of the drain field, which allows the bacteria to break down the solid waste and adds time between pumps.

PORT is designed so that you can "set it and forget it." All you have to do is pour it down your sink or toilet once a month. You can focus on your busy life and rest assured that your business is being taken care of.

![USDA Certified BioBased Product](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1680296849/Blog%20Images/USDA_Certified_BioBased_Product_okh1a1.png)

As a USDA Certified BioBased Product®, PORT is made of primarily biological products and therefore considered by the USDA as an alternative to petroleum-derived products.

PORT is such a powerful septic tank treatment that it can digest grease and break down solid waste like feminine hygiene products (although these should not be flushed down the toilet in the first place!). When you regularly maintain your septic tank with PORT, you will not have to worry about stressful septic clogs.

## **Benefits of Our Septic Tank Treatment**

Our PORT septic tank system treatment is unique because it contains live bacteria that digest difficult and non-biodegradable compounds, such as detergents, toilet paper, oil, grease, hydrocarbons and phenols. Unlike most septic tank treatment brands, PORT is powered by active bacteria that clears your home plumbing lines of solids and grease.

No more DIY hydrogen peroxide solutions or organic solvents to help clogged septic pipes. PORT is a much more innovative, simple and safe solution. Our septic tank treatment product has active bacteria cultures that can reduce solids with just one monthly dose.

### Eliminates Unpleasant Odors

PORT features a bacteria population that provides exceptional results controlling hydrogen sulfide and other mercaptan odors emitted from your septic system. Our tank treatment substrate is a novel and completely organic product that controls sulfide odors by blocking the pathways of sulfide-producing compounds.

The product is also unique in that it contains micro- and macro-nutrients that provide the necessary bacteria to accelerate microbial activity, growth and performance in septic systems.

PORT is different from septic tank treatment enzymes like Green Gobbler Septic Saver because it truly eliminates odors. Enzyme-only septic tank treatments can break down waste, but foul odors will typically still be present once your septic tank waste gets into your drain field. PORT truly eliminates odors instead of covering them up, so your septic system can be free of septic backups as well as gross smells.

### All-Natural, Safe and Environmentally Friendly

PORT works with nature—not against it—to break down solids and clear drain lines. Since it's powered by beneficial bacteria, PORT is completely safe for you, your family, your pets and the environment.

Whatever goes into your tank winds up in your drain field, an area that may double as your backyard where your pets and kids play. Since PORT is all natural, you don't have to worry about any toxic chemicals going into this drain field and threatening your safety. Plus, the runoff from your septic tank can impact the local groundwater system. By keeping harsh chemicals out of your septic system treatment, you can promote a healthy ecosystem.

## **Application Rate**

It's incredibly simple to apply PORT as a septic tank treatment. All you have to do is flush it down your toilet or pour it down your sink once per month.

If you're having a problem with your septic tank, we recommend pouring one quart. For regular maintenance, we recommend 8 oz. as a monthly dose. There's no need to make sure anything is properly diluted—just pour and let the good bacteria get to work. It's as simple as that!

### Pour the PORT Program
