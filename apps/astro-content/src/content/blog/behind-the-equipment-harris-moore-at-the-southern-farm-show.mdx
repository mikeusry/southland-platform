Ashley shared insight into her background, the family business and their most popular product: Creek View pulverizers.

## A Family-Run Business Rooted in Poultry Farming

[Harris-Moore Specialty Equipment](https://hmspecialtyequipment.com/ "Harris-Moore Speciality Equipment") is a father-daughter operation. Ashley and her father, former Perdue growers, bring decades of hands-on poultry experience to their work.

> “We were growers for Perdue for 41 years,” Ashley said. “We started in 1980 and closed up in 2021.”

Ashley grew up in the poultry houses, doing everything from feeding to mortality management. Their long history in poultry farming gives them a deep understanding of the equipment today’s growers need.

## From Growers to Equipment Specialists

Even while operating poultry houses, the Harris-Moore team was already selling equipment—something they've now focused on for the past 15 years. 

Today, they serve poultry growers across the U.S. and internationally, offering trusted solutions for litter management and sanitation.

## What Harris-Moore Offers

Ashley walked us through the key products they distribute:

-   **Creek View Equipment:** Pulverizers and windrowers for litter management
    
-   **Bestway Washers and Blowers:** Tools to blow down dust and fight insect infestations inside poultry houses
    

Harris-Moore is one of the largest Creek View distributors in the country.

## Spotlight on the Creek View Pulverizer

The Creek View Pulverizer LP96 (an 8-foot model) is their most popular piece of equipment, and it requires ~60 HP tractor. Other available sizes include:

-   **LP120 (10-foot):** Requires ~75 HP tractor
    
-   **LP78 (6-foot):** Requires ~45 HP tractor  
    

Prices range from $5,650 to $7,600, and impressively, Creek View has not raised prices since before COVID in 2021.

### What Sets It Apart

Ashley highlighted a few key features that make Creek View pulverizers stand out:

-   **Larger Box Than Competitors:** Holds more litter and allows multiple grinds before discharge
    
-   **Deeper Litter Penetration:** Designed to go two inches deep
    
-   **Free-Moving Flails:** Create a soft, powder-like finish
    

This process aerates litter, releases ammonia and ultimately improves bird health, including minimizing paw burns and keeping bedding warm and dry for baby chicks.

## Nationwide Shipping and Beyond

Though based in Spring Hope, North Carolina, Harris-Moore ships equipment all over the U.S.—and even as far as Jamaica and Peru.
