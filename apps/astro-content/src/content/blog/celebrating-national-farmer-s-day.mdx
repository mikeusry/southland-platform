October 12 is National Farmer’s Day. It's a time to recognize the dedication, resilience and hard work of the people who keep our nation fed.

At Southland Organics, we want to take a moment to say thank you to all the poultry growers who are often the unsung heroes of agriculture.

## The Backbone of the Poultry Industry

While the spotlight frequently shines on large integrators, it’s family-owned farms—97% of all poultry farms in the U.S.—that form the backbone of the industry.

The poultry sector contributes an impressive $70.2 billion in total value to the U.S. economy, supporting over 2 million jobs and generating more than $663 billion in overall economic impact. That strength comes from you: the growers who show up every day to care for your flocks, your land and your families.

## Why Your Work Matters

As Jason Jackson reminds us, “A nation that can’t feed itself doesn’t control itself.” The work you do is not just vital to your community—it’s a matter of national security.

Farming is hard work, but it’s also deeply rewarding. Every harvest, every flock and every long day contributes to something much bigger: a healthier, stronger and more secure America.

## Thank You from Southland Organics

From all of us at Southland Organics: thank you for your hard work, commitment and contribution to American agriculture.

Happy National Farmer’s Day!
