## Catalyst: A multivitamin bird booster for better performance

Have you had your vitamins today? More importantly, have your birds had _their_ vitamins today? 

At Southland Organics, we offer natural solutions to help growers. Our Catalyst Poultry Vitamin is no exception. With 10 key vitamins and minerals including folic acid, Vitamin D3 and Biotin, Catalyst provides the perfect nutritional boost for any flock. 

Here, Allen explains more about Catalyst and how to apply it to your flock:

 

## Your birds need vitamins, too!

You may take vitamins in the morning to keep your health in tip-top shape. Even though we forget to take them sometimes, we know that nutrients in these multivitamins like B12, Vitamin C and D, Iron and more are completely necessary for us to function as best as possible. Your birds work the same way! Chickens need vitamins just like we do. That’s why we sell our Catalyst Poultry Vitamin- it has all the vitamins birds need to perform their best and have stronger resistance to disease. 

## Optimize your flock with proper vitamin doses

Vitamin and mineral deficiencies produce countless health problems for poultry, including higher mortality. Catalyst Poultry Vitamin is packed with a specially formulated, poultry-specific combination of vitamins and minerals that maximize performance.

We know a lot of your time and effort is spent on your birds’ diet, where most of the emphasis is placed on their feed. Often the levels of vitamins in the diet of a flock is directly related to the calculated feed allotment that is managed by the integrator or farmer. This plays an important role in optimizing a flock because birds are limited to naturally occurring vitamins from free-range activities. 

The predominant focus of vitamins in poultry feed are fat-soluble vitamins. The fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K are stored for long periods of time. If there is not a balanced correlation with the water-soluble vitamins like those in Catalyst, then a higher risk of imbalance, poor performance and toxicity may occur in your flock.

## Make poultry nutrition easier with Catalyst Poultry Vitamin

When birds get a proper balance of fatty acids, amino acids, water-soluble vitamins and fat-soluble vitamins, then the immune system is greatly strengthened, and the immune response to diseases and other challenges is increased. Because of this, Catalyst is a great option to increase the health of your broiler chickens, game birds, turkey or laying hens!

Catalyst Poultry Vitamin is a highly absorbable powder that is quick and simple to apply. Using the scoop packaged with the vitamins, add 2 scoops of Catalyst into 5 gallons of stock solution for a medicator bucket set at a 1:128 ratio. Another rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon per 5 gallons of water! 

For the best results, we do recommend running Catalyst at the same time as our Big Ole Bird Poultry Probiotic. Big Ole Bird improves your birds’ nutrient uptake, which makes sure your birds are getting the most from their vitamins! To learn more about Big Ole Bird, check out our blog here.
