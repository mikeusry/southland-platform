Boost your roost with a multivitamin!

Catalyst Poultry Vitamin is specially formulated with poultry-specific vitamins and minerals that maximize health and boost immunity. Just like vitamins help keep you in your best health, Catalyst helps maximize your birds’ performance. Catalyst is easy to apply to your coop waterers and even easier for your birds to absorb, especially when they’re using our Hen Helper probiotic. 

Although we originally sold Catalyst only in a powder formula, we now have a liquid formula specifically for backyard chicken keepers! [Check it out here.](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/liquid-catalyst-poultry-vitamin?_pos=2&_psq=cat&_ss=e&_v=1.0 "Catalyst Poultry Vitamin Liquid Formula") Catalyst Poultry Vitamin Liquid Formula is easier to apply and more cost efficient for use with backyard chickens. 

Watch this video to learn more about how vitamins for chickens work and their benefits, like:

-   Promotes healthy leg and bone development
-   Boosts immunity
-   Supports heart, skin and blood health
-   Highly concentrated

Catalyst keeps your birds feeling their best! To apply Catalyst, just add a quarter teaspoon per gallon of your birds’ fresh drinking water once a week. 

We recommend using Catalyst at the same time as Hen Helper. Since Hen Helper increases nutrient uptake, your birds will get even more from Catalyst when they drink them at the same time!
