When it comes to poultry production, there are key differences in raising broilers, layers, pullets, turkeys and quail. But some fundamentals remain the same—especially when it comes to bird health. Today, we’re focusing on breeder hens and egg layers, and how Hen Helper is making a big difference in improving both productivity and profitability.

## What is Hen Helper?

[Hen Helper](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/hen-helper "Hen Helper Probiotics and Electrolytes for Chickens") is a specialized supplement designed to support layers and breeder hens, working similarly to our well-known product [Big Ole Bird](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/poultry-probiotic "Big Ole Bird Poultry Probiotic"). While Big Ole Bird is great for broilers, Hen Helper is fine-tuned to meet the additional demands of hens that produce eggs.

Like Big Ole Bird, Hen Helper helps:

-   Reduce mortality
    
-   Strengthen the immune system
    
-   Increase water consumption
    
-   Improve nutrient absorption
    

### Cleaner Eggs and Fewer Culls

The most frequent feedback from breeders using Hen Helper? Fewer culls and cleaner eggs.

Hen Helper supports gut health, which leads to firmer manure and a cleaner laying environment. This means eggs are less likely to get soiled, saving you time and improving hatch or sale quality. A healthy gut means a cleaner shell.

### Firmer Eggshells

Hen Helper enhances calcium absorption, helping birds lay eggs with firmer shells. Many farmers report fewer soft-shelled eggs and even a reduced need for additional calcium supplements like oyster shells.

## Real Results from Real Farmers

One breeder recently conducted his own trial using Hen Helper, and the results were impressive:

### 1\. Higher Hatchability

His average life flock hatch rate increased from 85–86% to 88%. That 2% gain may seem small, but over the life of a flock (46–50 weeks), it added up to a significant boost in income.

### 2\. Stronger Shells

Another noticeable improvement was shell quality. The farmer reported far fewer soft shells and consistently firmer shells throughout the flock's life. This points to better calcium absorption and overall improved nutrition.

### 3\. More Eggs Per Hen

Traditionally, this farmer saw about 156–158 eggs per hen. After using Hen Helper, the average jumped to 165–168. A nearby farmer participating in the trial saw an incredible 178 eggs per hen—a number his integrator had never seen before.

### 4\. Improved Feed Conversion

Feed efficiency also improved dramatically. One grower reported feed conversion “off the charts,” reinforcing that healthier hens are more efficient producers.

## Why It Matters

In today’s poultry industry, producers can’t always rely on reactive solutions like antibiotics or prescriptions. Challenges come fast, and not everything has a simple fix. That’s why proactive bird health is essential.

Hen Helper works from the inside out, building immune strength, improving digestion and helping birds overcome stress and illness naturally. Healthy birds are more resilient and more productive, especially when laying eggs.
