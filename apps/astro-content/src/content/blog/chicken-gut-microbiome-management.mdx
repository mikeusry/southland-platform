When it comes to your birds, microbes play a critical role in everything from nutrient absorption to disease resistance. That’s why fostering a balanced microbiome isn’t just about improving gut health; it’s a key factor in optimizing growth and resilience in your flocks. But here’s the catch—each flock’s microbiome is unique, and creating uniformity in gut health is a game-changer for growth and disease prevention.

## What is the gut microbiome?

The term “microbiome” refers to the millions of bacteria, fungi and other microbes living in the gut. Just as the human gut microbiome influences human health, the chicken gut microbiota directly impacts your flock's overall wellbeing. It’s an essential factor in poultry health and holds the potential to create healthier flocks, reduce antibiotic dependence and boost overall performance.

Gut microbes, including intestinal bacteria, play a vital role in sustaining the gut barrier—a physical and biochemical defense system that prevents harmful pathogens from entering the bloodstream while supporting nutrient absorption. In a healthy microbiome, there’s a balance between beneficial and potentially harmful bacteria. This balance of gut bacteria helps maintain strong immunity, efficient nutrient absorption and stable growth rates.

When harmful bacteria grow unchecked, they can reach a threshold where they begin communicating, or “quorum sensing,” and work together to attack the host. A balanced microbiome prevents this because beneficial bacteria can outcompete the harmful ones, maintaining a stable environment for the host—in this case, your birds.

### Microbiome Study Results

[A study in Denmark](https://modernpoultry.media/microbiome-mania-managing-our-expectations-for-this-new-science-in-the-poultry-industry/?mp=1731698006728 "Microbiome Mania: Managing Our Expectations for This New Science in the Poultry Industry") found a strong correlation between gut microbiome diversity and growth rates in broilers. Researchers observed that broilers with higher microbiome diversity at the individual level along with higher microbiome uniformity at the group level grew better and displayed fewer health issues than those with less balanced microbiomes.

### Supplements for a Healthy Balance

To keep a healthy balance, we recommend giving your birds supplements like [Big Ole Bird Poultry Probiotic](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/poultry-probiotic "Big Ole Bird Poultry Probiotic") and [Mother Load Apple Cider Vinegar](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/apple-cider-vinegar-for-chickens "Mother Load Apple Cider Vinegar"). With these supplements, you’re not only promoting healthy bacteria but also helping your birds’ immune system stay one step ahead of pathogens.

Big Ole Bird is a probiotic powerhouse that brings together beneficial bacteria, organic acids and carbon to enhance gut health and maintain gut microbiome diversity. With Big Ole Bird, you’re supporting a more consistent, resilient flock from the inside out.

When birds have a strong, healthy gastrointestinal tract, your nutrition program also goes further. This results in better feed conversion, tighter guts and healthier, bigger birds. The chicken’s gastrointestinal tract features blind sacs known as the ceca, which play a key role in microbial fermentation. Within the ceca, specialized bacterial populations break down fiber-rich dietary components into short-chain fatty acids, primarily acetate, butyrate and propionate. While other short-chain fatty acids are present, these three are the most readily available for nutrient absorption. Beneficial bacteria in the intestinal tract, supported by probiotics, enhance the activity of digestive enzymes while reducing harmful bacterial enzymes. This balance promotes better digestion, nutrient utilization and overall chicken health.

Mother Load is our premium apple cider vinegar and garlic blend formulated specifically for poultry. With Mother Load, you’re giving your birds an extra layer of support, particularly in managing pH levels in the gut. This can make it harder for harmful bacteria to thrive and can promote beneficial bacteria, which supports the overall microbiome balance—vital for immune health, digestion and nutrient absorption.

## Quorum Quenching

Pathogens like _E. coli_ and _Salmonella_ use quorum sensing to mount attacks. Our microbiome-supporting products help disrupt these signals, a concept known as quorum quenching. This strategy is part of what makes our products so effective at keeping harmful bacteria in check.

It's important to remember that the benefits of good poultry gut health aren't always immediately visible. Often, the most telling sign of your efforts is what you _don't_ see—disease and mortality. This lack of issues is proof that your commitment to supporting healthy intestinal microbiota is truly making a difference.
