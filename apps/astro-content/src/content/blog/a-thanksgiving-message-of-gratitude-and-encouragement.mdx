Your work sustains families, strengthens rural communities and feeds millions. Jason recently honored farmers for [National Farmer’s Day](https://www.southlandorganics.com/blogs/poultry-biosecurity/celebrating-national-farmer-s-day "Celebrating National Farmer's Day"). His message was spot-on, and I also want to offer my own expression of gratitude as we enter this season of reflection.

## Recognizing Your Hard Work

Poultry farming is demanding, often misunderstood and almost always underappreciated. Many people who buy chicken never see the long hours, the nighttime checks, the problem-solving or the constant pressure of caring for a live flock.

But we see it. And we’re grateful for it.

Thank you for the work you do to raise healthy birds, keep your farms operating and help feed the world.

## Gratitude vs. Thankfulness: A Small but Meaningful Difference

When my kids were young, I tried to teach them the difference between being thankful and being grateful. To us, thankfulness is what you feel, but gratitude is thankfulness expressed.

This time of year, frustrations can pile up—whether with integrators, service techs, repairs, supplies or the constant demands of managing your houses. We want to encourage you to take a moment to express appreciation to the people working alongside you: the crews in the houses, the folks handling catch, the techs who support your farm.

A simple “thank you” can go a long way.

## A Season to Encourage Others

The holiday season is a time when many people quietly struggle. Expressing gratitude can be an unexpected blessing to someone who needs encouragement, and it can be a blessing to you as well.

## From Our Family to Yours: Happy Thanksgiving

As we celebrate Thanksgiving, we want you to know how deeply we appreciate your hard work, your commitment and the impact you make every single day.

We hope this Thanksgiving brings rest, warmth and meaningful time with family.
