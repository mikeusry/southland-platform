At Southland Organics, we provide natural solutions to natural problems—and our natural solution to keeping your grass healthy throughout the hot summer is Omega Soil Activator. Omega is the second step in our three-step [natural lawn care program](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/natural-lawn-care-subscription "Natural Lawn Care Program").

## What is Omega Soil Activator?

![Omega Soil Activator](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1682300461/Blog%20Images/Omega_Soil_Activator_xm8axs.png)

After using [Genesis Soil Conditioner](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/genesis "Genesis Soil Conditioner") in the spring, the next step in our all-natural lawn care program is to use [Omega](https://www.southlandorganics.com/collections/homeowners/products/omega-soil-activator "Omega Soil Activator"), a natural soil activator for lawns, in the summer. Omega is our amplified formula of biologically active carbon and organic acids. The added proprietary blend of beneficial bacteria promotes nutrient uptake and builds grass that is resilient to disease and environmental stress. Omega contains 72 natural trace elements in a form that is readily available for your lawn’s soil to use.

### Secret Ingredients

Omega (and all of our other lawn care products!) leverage our three core features to supercharge soil with the building blocks turf grass needs to thrive.

![Microbes](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1682300460/Blog%20Images/Microbes_i7iv8p.png)

The added beneficial microbes help decompose residual pesticides and herbicides and unlock bound nutrients in the soil. This makes nutrients available to plants in simpler, more easily absorbed forms. Microbes amplify conventional programs by making your inputs work harder for longer.

![Organic acids](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1682300458/Blog%20Images/Organic_acids_ozjhto.png)

Organic acids and top-quality, organic carbon work to break surface tension of compacted soils and deliver oxygen to the root zone. Grass grows deeper roots in oxygenated soil, helping it resist disease and overtake weeds.

![Carbon](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1682300458/Blog%20Images/Carbon_mmiy4k.png)

Carbon is the main building block of all organic life. In fact, 50% of plant life is made up of carbon. Carbon feeds microbes and is critical to microbial health. The microbes, in turn, assimilate nutrients and deliver them to the roots for growth and development. Carbon is the ultimate macro element that lawns need to thrive.

With these three secret ingredients, plants develop deeper roots, retain water, resist disease and pests and become lush and healthy.

## How Omega Works

Let's break down how the second step in our all-natural lawn care program, Omega, works. When you feed the soil in the presence of stress, such as heat or unpredictable rainfall, you energize microorganisms and promote nutrient uptake to maximize the potential of grass. This builds fertile soil that is resilient to environmental changes.

Regardless of lawn type, to build an optimal soil structure, proper carbon levels and activity in the soil's indigenous microbes are essential. Unlike granular soil activators that may take longer to see results, our liquid soil activator adds necessary ingredients like humic acid to stimulate plant and root growth rapidly. By unlocking existing nutrients and maximizing uptake from previous applications, Omega promotes a fertile growing environment that makes the most of your other inputs.

Omega Soil Activator also addresses thatch buildup, breaks down other organic matter, aerates soil to continue delivering oxygen and valuable nutrients to the root zone, relieves soil compaction and addresses salt accumulations. Even applying a thin layer of Omega delivers usable food to your lawn to support root growth, soil energy and biological activity.

Omega is designed to boost conventional turf programs. We've studied the results of the applications, made tissue samples and monitored the application rates, and the results continue to prove that Omega will take your lawn (plus golf course greens and hydroseeding jobs) to the next level.

Because Omega is such an effective soil activator, you may be wondering how much it costs. Well, here's the good news: Before you apply one of our concentrated lawn products like Omega, you typically dilute it at a 1:20 product to water ratio. With this mixture, a little goes a long way, making it a cost-effective solution!

### How Omega Impacts Soil Structure

![Soil health](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1682300460/Blog%20Images/Soil_health_npindv.png)

Soil texture is important because it determines the success of plant growth. Poor soils typically have a bad soil texture and may be described as "clumpy soil," but liquid soil activators like Omega can aerate and break up soils like this. Even sandy soil can benefit from soil activators when the soil receives added nutrients that may otherwise leach through easily.

Omega improves soil structure by increasing water retention, aerating the soil and adding plant nutrients. Like many soil activators, it improves poor soils by improving the way soil particles fit together and adding organic matter throughout.

Omega can break up clay soils and free up nutrients to be more available to plant roots. Overall, soil activators improve soil structure in poor soils by adding more living organisms and minerals. Improved soil means that the soil is more loose and "crumbly," but it holds together when damp and can sustain plant roots. Omega improves poor soils by addressing their structure.

Humic acid helps improve soil structure by adding new microbes to those already existing in the soil. In addition to lawns, indoor plants, potted plants and gardens can benefit from this improved structure as well.

### How Omega Differs from Commercial Soil Activators

Inorganic fertilizers and soil activators often include chemicals that can harm the environment in the long run. In our "fast green" world, we've built up an illusion that lawn products should make our grass look green instantly. This is due to many high nitrogen fertilizers pumping grass with too much nitrogen. While this result may give you instant gratification, it does little for soil improvement and actually harms the environment through excess nutrient runoff.

Omega focuses on the true health of the soil so that you can have healthy root growth and plant growth for the long run. Products like Omega are considered biological activators because of a complex bio catalyst process they initiate in the soil. They also address soil health instead of only focusing on fast, visible results.

## **More Benefits of Omega**

Lawns need several minor elements to become healthy and stay that way. While some of these elements are required in very small amounts, they are still essential to plant health. Omega provides these necessary trace elements in a form that is easy for your lawn grasses to use. Omega also improves drought resistance and temperature tolerance. By promoting deeper root growth, Omega makes your lawn stronger and better able to resist the summer heat and droughts.

With its safe, natural mixture of beneficial bacteria, Omega adds necessary ingredients like humic acid to stimulate plant and root growth rapidly. By unlocking existing soil nutrients and maximizing uptake from previous applications, Omega promotes a fertile growing environment that makes the most of your other inputs. 

## **How to Use Omega** 

The summer is the best time to apply a soil activator like Omega. Apply 6–8 oz. of Omega per 1,000 square feet in a sprayer diluted at a 1:20 product to water ratio.

To find out exactly when and how much Omega to apply, take our [quick quiz](https://www.videoask.com/fyahikle6 "Lawn Care Quiz"). After you take the quiz, we’ll recommend a custom plan for your lawn for the entire growing season.

### **What to Expect** 

Omega delivers usable food to your lawn to support root growth, soil energy and biological activity. Since Omega is all natural, you don’t have to worry about harming people, pets or the planet. This means a green lawn for you without harsh chemical runoff! 

## Natural Products to Complement Omega

### Revival Liquid Lawn Aerator

If you have grass clippings or thatch buildup to address, we recommend using the next step in our natural lawn care program, [Revival Liquid Lawn Aerator](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/turf-revival "Revival Liquid Lawn Aerator"). This product has a similar base to Omega, but it includes healthy microbial activity specifically selected to address thatch buildup and lawn aeration at the end of the summer.

### Ultimate Tea
