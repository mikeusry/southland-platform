"Keys to Windrow Success, Part 2: Annihilate" is the third video in our Poultry Biosecurity Windrow Series. In our last video, we discussed how to set your windrow up for success through balancing your key components of temperature, width, depth and moisture. Now Jason Jackson takes us even deeper into best practices for successful windrows through the explanation of turning. Following these guidelines will help you maximize bacteria annihilation in your windrows which, as we learned in our earlier videos, is the goal!

As Jason explains in the video, timing and proper temperature are essential in processing windrows. The ideal temperature for annihilating bacteria is 135° but to kill the maximum amount of bacteria, you must ensure every part of the litter reaches this temperature. This is why we turn windrows.

When the core heat of a windrow pile peaks around 12–24 hours, it will slowly start to cool. Heat then begins to transfer from the center to the outside layer. You must turn the windrows from the outside to the inside 3 to 4 days after the initial formation to help ensure each part of the pile reaches ideal annihilation temperature.

Completing a minimum of two heat cycles is recommended, but sometimes you will not have enough time between flocks to turn twice. Just remember to allow a few days for the litter to dry and ammonia to dissipate.

As good as maximum bacteria annihilation sounds—you have just gotten rid of the good with the bad. A clean slate is the perfect environment for bad bacteria to take over. You need to repopulate the good, natural defenses. We talk all about that in [Keys to Windrow Success, Part 3: Repopulate](https://www.southlandorganics.com/blogs/poultry-biosecurity/video-keys-to-windrow-success-part-3-repopulation "Keys to Windrow Success, Part 3: Repopulate").
