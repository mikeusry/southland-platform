"Keys to Windrow Success, Part 1: Set Up" is the second video in our Poultry Biosecurity Windrow Series. Our good friend and poultry farmer, Jason Jackson, takes us to ground zero with best practices for setting up windrows. Following these guidelines will prepare you for the next step in the windrow process, and you will be well on your way to winning the fight against bad bacteria.

If you’ve been in commercial poultry for more than a few weeks, you’ve likely heard of or been required to windrow in your house. It can take a lot of time and energy. Maybe you know what to do and have it down to a science, but you don’t quite know WHY you do it. That’s why we’re here.

When the poultry industry went antibiotic-free, a giant mess of problems arose from seemingly every layer of your house—from the floor to the birds to even the air you breathe. All of these problems find their roots in the same place—bad bacteria overgrowth. Windrowing helps annihilate the bad bacteria. Windrowing is the first step in biosecurity of your house. Though it may seem tedious, when done consistently and correctly, annihilating bad bacteria begins the process of building a foundational firewall against all sorts of disease in your house.

**Don't forget—a healthy floor is a healthy bird!**

As Jason Jackson discusses in the video, the target temperature to kill bacteria is 135°. Additionally, you should aim for your windrow piles to be 4–5 ft. wide and 3 ft. tall with a moisture content level of 30–35%. By using a strategic application of temperature, proper depth and width, and correct moisture levels, your windrows will be set up for success. But, there are additional important steps for maximum bacteria annihilation.
