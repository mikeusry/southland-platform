PORT, an innovative outdoor restroom and holding tank treatment, has revolutionized waste management for a major paper mill in the southeastern United States. By leveraging PORT's capability to rapidly degrade waste and control odors, the paper mill has not only enhanced its operational efficiency but also significantly improved its environmental sustainability.

PORT's unique formulation, which is harmless to humans, animals, and marine life and capable of breaking down tough compounds, underscores its exceptional benefits. This case study illustrates the crucial role of PORT in resolving the mill's waste management challenges, reinforcing the importance of advanced, eco-friendly solutions in industrial settings.

## PORT's Remarkable Results

The use of PORT at a paper mill demonstrated remarkable results in managing waste in the facility’s aeration pond. Following a 10-day treatment period, the Total Suspended Solids (TSS) levels in the pond saw a dramatic reduction to 5,810 pounds, marking a 58.9% decrease. Furthermore, the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) levels significantly dropped to an average of 16,000, translating to a 63.5% reduction. These results not only signify PORT's effectiveness in breaking down and managing waste but also highlight its ability to substantially improve the overall efficiency of waste treatment processes at the mill.

Moving forward, the management team at the paper mill has decided to integrate PORT into their regular waste management routine. They plan to use this solution continuously to maintain low levels of TSS and BOD in their aeration pond. By doing so, they aim to extend the operational lifespan of their waste treatment facilities and further reduce their environmental impact. They stated:

"We are incredibly pleased with the results provided by PORT and Southland Organics' solution. It has surpassed our expectations in effectively managing our waste issues, significantly reducing odor, and enhancing the efficiency of our wastewater treatment processes. The cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits have solidified our decision to continue using this treatment as part of our long-term sustainability strategy."

## Why It Worked

At the heart of this case study lies the transformative impact of PORT on operational efficiency and environmental compliance. Recognized for their substantial waste management needs and commitment to sustainable practices, the implementation of PORT offered a seamless and effective solution to their challenges.

### **Effective Waste Degradation and Odor Control**

One of the primary benefits realized by the paper mill was PORT's exceptional ability to rapidly degrade waste and control odors. Unlike conventional methods that mask odors, PORT eliminates them at the source by breaking down solid waste and clearing bio-solids. This ensured a healthier and more pleasant environment for both employees and the surrounding community, aligning with the paper mill's goals of maintaining high environmental standards.

### **Environmental Protection and Safety**

Central to the paper mill's mission was the commitment to minimizing its ecological footprint. PORT's eco-friendly formulation was perfectly aligned with this goal. Being harmless to human, animal and marine life, the product bolstered the mill's environmental stewardship. Moreover, its ability to digest toxic compounds without harming beneficial bacteria or causing corrosion to equipment marked a significant advantage, ensuring the mill's operations did not detrimentally impact local ecosystems.

### **Operational Efficiency and Cost Savings**

Implementing PORT led to a noticeable improvement in the mill's operational efficiency. With its ability to digest even difficult detergents, fats, oils, tissues and hydrocarbons, PORT kept the mill's waste management systems running smoothly, significantly reducing the likelihood of clogs and the need for frequent maintenance. This not only extended the life of the mill's infrastructure, but also translated to substantial cost savings in terms of maintenance and operational downtime.

### **Enhanced Compliance and Reputation**

In an industry where regulatory compliance and reputation are crucial, the adoption of PORT helped the paper mill meet stringent waste management regulations while bolstering its reputation as a leader in environmental stewardship. The non-corrosive, non-pathogenic nature of PORT meant that the mill was not only in compliance with environmental standards but was also setting a benchmark for sustainable practices in the industry.

## Conclusion

Through the implementation of PORT, the paper mill successfully addressed its waste management challenges, showcasing a commitment to environmental excellence and operational efficiency. The tangible benefits realized—ranging from effective waste degradation and odor control to operational cost savings and enhanced environmental compliance—underscore the significance of adopting innovative, sustainable solutions in today's industrial landscape. PORT not only provided a solution to immediate challenges but also positioned the paper mill as a forward-thinking, environmentally responsible entity within the industry.

The use of PORT demonstrated remarkable results in managing waste in the facility’s aeration pond. Following a 10-day treatment period, the Total Suspended Solids (TSS) levels in the pond saw a dramatic reduction to 5,810 pounds, marking a 58.9% decrease. Furthermore, the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) levels significantly dropped to an average of 16,000, translating to a 63.5% reduction. These results not only signify PORT's effectiveness in breaking down and managing waste but also highlight its ability to substantially improve the overall efficiency of waste treatment processes at the mill.
