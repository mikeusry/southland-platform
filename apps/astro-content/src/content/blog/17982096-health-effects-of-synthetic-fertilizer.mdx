## What are the threats of synthetic fertilizers? Are there safe alternatives?

Despite their seemingly quick impact, synthetic fertilizers can seriously deplete the nutritional content of foods. Direct contact or exposure to synthetic chemical fertilizer can harm babies and cause health problems for many people. Remember this the next time you want to boost your plant growth and pick up a bag of synthetic fertilizer at Walmart.

In 2012, I wrote this original article as a bit of a rant on why organic fertilizers are a safer choice for agriculture and why they should be used more often in both organic and inorganic agriculture. I saw this blog immediately gain traction, and in 2014 I made a video to explain a bit more.

As I update this blog in 2024, I see that the video's branding is outdated, but the message I share is not. I still believe in this message and the information in this blog. Thank you for your interest in educating yourself on organic vs synthetic fertilizers.

## Impact of Synthetic Fertilizer

Why are synthetic fertilizers bad? If you have any type of urinary, kidney or liver difficulties, you should especially avoid any type of exposure to inorganic fertilizer. Synthetic fertilizers disadvantages are often underplayed and ignored despite their damage being far-reaching. Synthetic fertilizer can cause a vast array of symptoms. Some are immediate, some signs show up later, some are direct and some effects are indirect. Synthetic fertilizers include many brand names: Scotts, Miracle Grow (owned by Scotts), Shultz, Pennington, TruGreen, etc.

I recently became very interested in the subject after reading about the physical symptoms of workers handling chemical fertilizers and the harsh air of a retail garden area.

In the U.S., generally there are three hyphenated numbers (for example 15-5-10) on the front label of fertilizer bags representing the percentage of each element by weight in the bag. The elements represented are Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium. For example, the expression "15-5-10" means: 15% of the weight of the bag contains Nitrogen, 5% contains phosphorous and 10% contains Potassium.

Upon further reading a bag, you will see an analysis of the types of chemical compounds used in order to reach these percentages. The synthetic matter used to reach these percentages of 15-5-10 can be different in different chemical fertilizers. Some chemicals are more harsh than others, but they all end up being harmful chemicals to plants and animals.

These components written on the bag are "guaranteed" to be in the bag by law. What is written on the bag must be in the bag. These synthetic chemical compounds can be directly and indirectly harmful in a number of ways. More on that later.

## Issues with Chemical Fertilizer Regulation

You will notice in the above example that 15-5-10 add up to a total of 30% of the weight of the bag. What is in the other 70% of the bag? It is not disclosed. It can be just about anything...including industrial waste. Some things this mysterious 70% could contain are clay, sand, sawdust, perlite, rice hulls, calcium carbonate, corn cob grit, vermiculite, limestone, sludge and slag.

![inorganic materials in fertilizers](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1639514247/Blog%20Images/inorganic_materials_in_fertilizers.png)

Most people would be skeptical to believe that toxic residues from industry would be used to fill up the majority of a bag of synthetic fertilizer. It is actually widespread. An independent research group tested fertilizers from only 12 states for 22 toxic heavy metals and found that they contained high levels of these toxic substances. Of the 29 fertilizers tested, some were major and popular brands. Lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, barium, chromium, nickel, beryllium, and dioxin were all found. These toxic chemicals become part of where your kids and pets play, dust people breathe, water runoff, accumulation in soils and plant life.

These fertilizers release harmful chemicals that are are known or suspected carcinogens, toxic to reproductive, developmental, liver and blood health. In about a five year period, 270 million pounds of toxic waste was sent to fertilizer companies and farms according to reports from 44 different states. Regulations are extremely strict if industry wishes to dispose of toxic waste in lined landfills. However, regulations are relatively lax if they transfer the waste or resell it. In other words, the simplest method of getting rid of toxic waste is just to resell it. So, unwittingly we become consumers who purchase toxic waste for soil fertility. Conventional agriculture does this knowingly.

Unlike chemical fertilizer, organic fertilizers and farmers face strict regulations for supporting fertile soil. For example, conventional farmers are not required to delay harvesting after applying fresh manure. Organic farmers must wait 90-120 days between application of raw manure as organic fertilizer and the harvest of any organic crop which may be eaten raw. This allows the natural fertilizers time to compost and thus prevents the spread of any potentially dangerous bacteria. But why are organic fertilizers under such scrutiny when artificial fertilizer can literally contain toxic waste?

## More on Powdered Minerals

Back to N-P-K. Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium. These are three of the 72 naturally occurring elements. These are essential for plant cell growth. There are about 10 other minerals which are also essential for plant cell growth, but even more that are very _important_ for soil health and plant health.

Oxygen, Carbon and Hydrogen are three essential nutrients for plants. Their respective percentages in a whole plant are roughly 45%, 44% and 6%. Compared to the percentages of these nutrients and the percentages of all the other minerals, Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium have relatively low percentages. However, these three elements have been over-played and over-emphasized with the commercial, synthetic fertilizers for a variety of reasons.

![organic vs synthetic fertilizer](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1639514247/Blog%20Images/organic_vs_synthetic_fertilizer.png)

It should be noted that there is a natural balance for healthy soil and plant growth which includes microbes and the environment. When the synthetic and unnatural force-feeding of chemicals occurs, the balance gets out of wack and problems occur. So, adding just these three elements is as nutty as feeding your children only Cheerios, milk and juice. In fact, these three elements added synthetically can dramatically upset how plants can absorb the other necessary mineral elements. These are only 3 of 13 essential elements- it is not a natural, balanced diet for plants.

I should mention that weeds serve a natural function in that they often grow where soil is less alive or in hardship. You will see weeds sprout up like crazy on bare exposed earth or in soils not properly balanced. Often weeds will pull up minerals and nutrients, almost in an attempt to restore a balance. You probably notice sand burrs in sandy soils lacking humus. Or you might notice the graded lot with bare exposed soil lacking in its topmost fertile layers become prolific with weeds. Fortunately, some farmers now have curbed their plowing and exposing of nutritious soils by a "no-till system." Mother nature has weeds there to balance some of the offsets. I am not promoting weeds, but just explaining some factors which bring about weeds, and thus, use of these extremely toxic herbicides.

Synthetic fertilizers do more to offset the natural balance than to restore it. Organic fertilizers release nutrients to keep soil fertile in a natural way through a variety of necessary nutrients.

## Synthetic Nitrogen and Soil Structure

Nitrogen (when forcibly fed to plants) is known for promoting rapid excessive green growth, much like steroids in a human. Nitrogen is the big player in commercial fertilizers. It rapidly gives the appearance of lush green growth when applied on a lawn. This certainly could drive sales of commercial synthetic fertilizers. However, this application actually causes harm to plants and animals in a number of ways.

Commercial synthetic fertilizers boomed following World War ll. Ammonium nitrate had been used for munitions and explosives during the war. An outlet for these producers post-war was found in the fertilizer marketplace. It is now a major source of nitrogen for synthetic fertilizers.

### Dangers of Synthetic Nitrogen

Ammonia, a base, is extremely toxic to humans. It has a sharp penetrating odor. Nitric acid is mixed with ammonia to form a salt, ammonium nitrate (NH3NO3). It can easily have reactions if exposed to a variety of metals, acids, alkalis, solvents, oil or grease. You will notice that bags of fertilizer are often plastic coated and sealed in order to keep contaminants out and gases in.

Storage alone will give off ammonia. Introduce heat to fertilizer and there will be further instability. The release of toxic fumes is one of the main hazards associated with the decomposition of ammonium nitrate. Exposure can cause eye and skin irritation and burns. Inhalation can result in irritation of the nose, throat and lungs. One can also experience nausea, vomiting, flushing of the face and neck, headache, nervousness, uncontrolled muscle movements, faintness and collapse. Because ammonia or nitrates combine rapidly with water, feeling dehydrated is common.

The next time you handle or are exposed to chemical fertilizer, you will probably notice some of these symptoms. Because the accumulation of ammonia in the body can quickly lead to death, the urea cycle in humans is extremely important.

### How Nitrate can Become Toxic

Nitrate is converted to a very toxic substance (nitrite) within the digestive systems of human infants and also different livestock. During the first few months of an infant's life, there exists a bacteria in the stomach which changes the nitrate to nitrite. Nitrite is extremely toxic and reacts with the hemoglobin in the blood to cut out the oxygen supply and then produce toxic reactions. A baby will suffocate if not given immediate medical attention during this reaction. Signs include parts of the body turning blue or the blood turning chocolate brown. These signs occur with both humans and animals. Some livestock will go into convulsions and then die.

Pregnant mothers should also dramatically avoid non organic fertilizers. Also, you certainly would not want to expose any of your young pets to fertilizer. As a baby gets older, the hydrochloric acid in the stomach kills off the bacteria which changes the nitrate to nitrite. It should be noted that the bacteria which convert the nitrate into the deadly nitrite can still exist in adults to various degrees.

### Nitrogen in the Human Body

Nitrogen is an essential constituent of proteins. In humans, when our proteins (amino acids) breakdown, the nitrogen waste from the protein turns to ammonia (NH3). Ammonia is very toxic, but the liver along with other body functions quickly convert the ammonia into a less toxic substance, urea \[(NH2)2CO\]. While urea has some toxicity, we excrete it when we go to the bathroom or sweat.

However, the body is set up to process and handle nitrogen waste only at a constant rate. If there is too much nitrogen waste for the body to handle at one time, you will notice that you start to feel poorly. The highly toxic ammonia content starts to buildup in the body (and possibly the less toxic urea buildup if there are difficulties with the kidneys or other body systems). You might personally observe this at those times you eat too much in proteins, such as meat.

Some bacteria and parasites in the body also can dump toxic ammonia into the system, causing similar symptoms. So, you can imagine how stressful this is on a body's system when nitrogen from non organic fertilizers enters the body through the air, skin or ingestion. Also, ammonia can easily affect the brain, which lacks the enzyme essential for changing it into urea.

### Nitrate in Non Organic Fertilizers

![toxin buildup from fertilizer](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1639514248/Blog%20Images/toxin_buildup_from_fertilizer.png)

Synthetic fertilizers can contain any number of chemical combinations of nitrate, ammonia, urea or other chemicals to satisfy the N-P-K rule. On the label below the numbers, you will see the chemicals used, primarily water soluble nutrients and phosphorus. Close relatives to ammonium nitrate may be used to satisfy the nitrogen content (and perhaps the P or K content). Urea may also be used. However, this urea is the synthetic version made from ammonia and carbon dioxide. Some others listed on a bag of fertilizer could be calcium nitrate, sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, ammoniated super-phosphate, triple super phosphate (disadvantages of triple superphosphate include that it's incredibly harmful to soil quality), potassium chloride, potassium sulfate and potash.

### As an aside: What are the negative consequences of the creation of synthetic fertilizer?

Sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate (sometimes called saltpeter) have many similar characteristics and chemical properties. Gunpowder is made by adding sulfur and charcoal to this. Normally, meat turns gray when cooked. This (or the nitrite form) is what is often used to keep meats pink, even though the meats may have been cooked during processing. You will probably see it as an ingredient on the packages of many foods (hot dogs, bacon, pepperoni, etc). To a certain degree it does inhibit bacteria. In food it can be beneficial to inhibit bacteria, but in soil it is one of the worst things you can do.

However, there are many more effective and safer ways to inhibit bacteria on foods. The primary use of this salt in foods is to keep color. It takes 10 times the amount which inhibits bacteria in order to achieve this color preservation effect.

Sodium nitrite has been shown to cause cancer as a result of its reactions in the stomach. Of course, you just read the data about how the body processes nitrogen or the toxic effects of nitrite. It is kind of hard to believe that this substance is still prolifically put in foods primarily to make them sell better. Sodium (or potassium) nitrate can really irritate the respiratory track with a shortness of breath if the dust is inhaled. It can cause all kinds of gastric and stomach pains, dizziness, bloody diarrhea, convulsions, headaches, mental impairments, redness or itching on the skin or eyes and collapse.

## Organic Fertilizers and Soil Microbiology

The air is about 80% nitrogen. In nature, this is where the nitrogen nutrient originates. It can be brought into the soil by rain, other plants (such as legumes: alfalfa, clover, peas, etc.), other organisms (such as blue-green algae or microbes) and the decay of other green plants.

There are about fifty billion microbes in a tablespoon of healthy soil, and more near the roots of plants. Their primary job is to break down organic matter and feed plants. You could have every element in its proper proportion available in the soil, but without the microbial action plants would not be able to utilize them.

### Synthetic Fertilizers: Disadvantages to Microbiology

Synthetic chemical fertilizers actually inhibit, kill and alter this natural microbial activity which is so very important to healthy plants. In healthy soil there are herds of microbes near the roots of plants which out-compete pathogenic species and form a protective layer on the surface of living plant roots. Microbes are essential in making minerals available to plants and they also retain large quantities of nutrients (such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulfur) in their bodies, which helps to prevent these nutrients from being leached or washed away. Some microbes eat the dead cells of other microbes, thus retaining the nutrients within the soil.

In the natural process, predator organisms which eat other microbes get too much nitrogen in relation to the carbon that they require. It takes 30 parts of carbon to assimilate one part of nitrogen in a normal soil. When the predator microbe consumes excessive amounts of nitrogen, it is released into the soil as nitrate. Plants can only use nitrogen in the nitrate form. For example, ammonia nitrogen can not be accessed by plants until it is broken down into the nitrate form by microbial action. A variety of consequences occur when plants are forcibly fed too much nitrogen from non organic fertilizers, especially in the direct nitrate forms you have seen in synthetic fertilizers.

The plant can absorb only so much nitrate. Nitrate dissolves very easily in water. But the real clincher is that it is EXTREMELY difficult to remove from water. So, the excess nitrate gets washed away. Generally, the farther water travels through soil, the safer it becomes as contaminants are diluted or filtered out. Nitrate is the exception. It can ruin well water and one would have to dig a new well where no nitrate leaching has occurred. Older folks like me have watched our vibrant and clear creeks, streams, rivers, and lakes change over the years. In fact, in Texas it is now illegal to eat fish caught from their waters because of their toxicity. This is largely due to the amount of chemicals we put onto our soil. Nitrate is in your tap water (and perhaps bottled water). It is not removed by filtering, boiling or softening. Treatment for nitrate removal from water is very complicated and expensive. My personal consideration is that this is a method in which synthetic fertilizers can harm people or pets and soil in the long-term. There is another consequence with synthetic chemical fertilizers. This is probably the worst effect of all.

## Microbes Destroyed by Non Organic Fertilizer

An incredible interaction and activity exists with plants and microbes and other organisms and the environment. This processing of organic matter, nutrients and minerals is immensely complex and delicate. It is almost laughable to think that one can throw three elements in the form of synthetic chemicals onto the soil and say, "Now I have balanced the mineral and biological and ion and pH and microbial content of the soil." The exact opposite occurs. Microbes are destroyed or inhibited in their balance when synthetics arrive. Microbes help to provide proper pH. Organic material alive with microbes is electrically charged and so there is ion action. The artificial force feeding of these three elements throw the balance of other minerals and nutrients completely off within the plant. This stresses the plant, making the plant deficient in nutrients. Stressed plants attract diseases and pests. That is nature's way of handling the sick. Then, because the plant has bugs or a fungus, someone comes along with a chemical pesticide or fungicide in order to try to remedy the situation. In fact, many soil microbes directly attack and kill insect pests, and many also directly fight off plant diseases. An example is that sulfur uptake into a plant can be inhibited by artificial fertilizers. 

Fifty years ago in the United Kingdom, when natural methods of fertility were used, the dairy cows did not really have a problem with lice. But now there is a problem with these type of exterior parasites. You may have seen over chemicalized soils appear colorless, bleached or salty. The carbon fraction (the

![beneficial microbiology](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1639514248/Blog%20Images/beneficial_microbiology.png)

humus) gets burned up in the assimilation process of nitrogen. Synthetics can change the pH and tie up beneficial elements, but also can start to cause toxicity levels of other elements. Artificial inducement of one element can cause all kinds of weird bonding to occur with other elements. This all translates to the foods which we eat. With naturally grown foods, you do not have to worry about pesticides or herbicides, but probably the best benefit of organic foods is their nutritional content. The difference can be dramatic. This includes livestock and poultry which are fed naturally grown grasses and food. As a culture, we are becoming more and more nutritionally deficient and filled with toxic residues as an indirect result of synthetic fertilizers. This stresses the body, making it more prone to health problems.

In other words, non organic fertilizer can dramatically diminish the nutritional value of foods. Since synthetic fertilizers also diminish the natural disease-fighting and pest-fighting mechanisms, our foods thus become laden with other chemicals (pesticides and herbicides). So, we end up with foods which are lacking in viable nutrition and also loaded with residues form other chemicals. This kind of activity is not healthy for humans or animals. This consequence is probably the worst of all, especially in light of the fact that more natural methods of growing plants are easier, more economical and more viable.

**Fact: Synthetic fertilizers can deplete the nutritional content of foods.**

Wow, did you know that synthetic fertilizers can deplete the nutritional content of our food? It's true! According to a study published on ResearchGate, the widespread use of synthetic fertilizers has had a negative impact on plant nutrition. These fertilizers, while they may help crops grow faster and produce larger yields, often lack essential nutrients that are vital for our health. This means that the fruits and vegetables we consume may not be as nutritious as we think they are. But don't worry, there is a solution! By opting for natural fertilizers, opting for smartly sourced produce, or even growing your own food using natural compost and fertilizers, you can ensure that you're getting the full spectrum of nutrients your body needs to thrive. So let's start embracing organic farming methods and make sure our plates are filled with nutrient-rich goodness!

**Fact: Organic fertilizers are a safer choice for agriculture.**

Did you know that organic fertilizers are a safer choice for agriculture? Using organic fertilizers can have a positive impact on the environment, as well as on our health. Unlike synthetic fertilizers, which can leach harmful chemicals into the soil and water supply, organic fertilizers are made from natural sources, such as compost and manure. This means that they are free from harmful chemicals and toxins that can harm plants, animals, and even humans. So if you're looking to make a greener choice for your lawn or garden, consider switching to organic fertilizers. Your plants will thank you, and so will the planet!

**Fact: Independent research has found high levels of toxic heavy metals in synthetic fertilizers.**

Did you know that independent research has found high levels of toxic heavy metals in synthetic fertilizers? These dangerous chemicals can contaminate our soil and water, leading to potential health risks for humans and animals. Studies have also shown that these toxins can accumulate in plants, meaning that the food we eat may contain traces of these hazardous substances. That's why it's so important to choose organic fertilizers over synthetic ones. Organic fertilizers are made from natural sources, such as compost and manure, and are free from harmful chemicals and toxins.

**Fact: Regulations for disposing of toxic waste in lined landfills are strict, but relatively lax if the waste is transferred or resold.**

Did you know that regulations for disposing of toxic waste in lined landfills are strict, but relatively lax if the waste is transferred or resold? This means that even though we have measures in place to protect our environment, there are still loopholes that allow for potential harm. But wait, there's more! The implications of this fact are immense and can have serious consequences for our planet and its inhabitants. It's important to be aware of these issues and advocate for more stringent regulations to prevent further damage. So let's take action and spread the word about the need for responsible waste management. Together, we can make a difference and create a safer, cleaner world for future generations.

**Fact: Organic farmers face strict regulations for supporting fertile soil, including delaying harvesting after applying fresh manure.**

Did you know that organic farmers face strict regulations when it comes to supporting fertile soil? According to the FDA's Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), organic farmers are required to delay harvesting after applying fresh manure. This regulation ensures that the soil is properly nourished and free from any potential contaminants. It's exciting to see how these regulations contribute to the overall safety and quality of organic produce. So, next time you enjoy a delicious organic meal, remember that it was grown with love and care, following strict guidelines to support fertile soil and provide you with the best possible food. Cheers to healthy eating!
