We consider our raw, garlic-infused apple cider vinegar (ACV) to be the "mother" of all vinegars. Since [Mother Load](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/apple-cider-vinegar-for-chickens) is unpasteurized and unfiltered, it has the vinegar mother, acetic acid bacteria and all the benefits that go along with them.

## Why choose unpasteurized, unfiltered ACV?

Acetic acid is a naturally-occurring substance in apple cider vinegar. It's what turns apples into vinegar, in addition to having beneficial bacteria. Our ACV is also unfiltered, so it still has the "mother." This is a digestive enzyme full of more beneficial microbes. 

When pasteurized, the helpful bacteria is killed off, thus removing any benefits they could offer. But in our unpasteurized, unfiltered ACV, this microbiology is still intact and ready to improve your birds' health.

To offer even stronger benefits, Mother Load is a 60 grain ACV, compared to the 40 grain vinegar that you would buy at the grocery store. This means more bang for your buck and better gut function for your birds!

### What about the garlic?

Garlic offers a host of health benefits, which is why we add it to Mother Load:

-   Supports the immune system
-   Reduces odors in chicken manure
-   Antibacterial agent that can stop bacteria from growing, helping to protect from infections
-   Stimulates the appetite and drinking
-   Birds like the taste
-   Contains allicin, which makes the chickens’ blood taste bad to [mites](https://www.southlandorganics.com/blogs/news/how-to-get-rid-of-chicken-mites "Chicken Mites")

## How to Run Mother Load

For the first one to two days of your birds' lives, add 12 ounces of [Mother Load](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/apple-cider-vinegar-for-chickens) per gallon of water. You may have to charge the lines before applying.

After the first one to two days, wait a week, then apply 12 ounces per gallon for one day. On week three, apply 12 ounces per gallon one more time.

From then on, you can decrease to apply six ounces of Mother Load per gallon of water once per week. Continue this schedule through the rest of the grow out. 

For more information on application rates for Mother Load and our other products, [watch this video guide](https://www.southlandorganics.com/pages/big-ole-bird-instructions). 

### Caution: Do Not Over-Apply

Note that Mother Load is **not** a product you can apply every day. [Dr. Susan Watkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-watkins-a2429a21/ "Dr. Susan Watkins") of the University of Arkansas has said that ACV can cause biofilm buildup on nipples if overused.

Apple cider vinegar is a weak acid, so if over-applied, it can irritate and loosen the gut. If you choose to apply ACV multiple times per week, be sure to reduce the application rate to just two or three ounces per gallon of water.
