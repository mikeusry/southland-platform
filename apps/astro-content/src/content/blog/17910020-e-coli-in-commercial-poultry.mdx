Within recent weeks, our phones have been ringing with poultry growers concerned with a much larger presence of _Escherichia coli_ than usual.

## What is Escherichia coli infection?

![Poultry Escherichia coli](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1678285064/Blog%20Images/Poultry_Escherichia_coli_y57p0y.png)

Typically found in the intestinal tract of animals, including chickens, _Escherichia coli_ (_E. coli_) is a type of bacteria. Avian pathogenic _Escherichia coli_ (APEC) is a pathogenic, or disease-causing, form of _E. coli_ that can cause health problems in chickens, and in severe cases, death.

_E. coli_ in chickens can also be a concern for the health of human beings, as some _E. coli_ strains can be transmitted to humans through contact with contaminated poultry products. This can lead to food poisoning, and some [studies](https://nutritionfacts.org/2022/11/03/the-link-between-chicken-consumption-and-urinary-tract-infections/#:~:text=Poultry%20are%20considered%20to%20be,the%20potential%20to%20cause%20UTIs. "E. Coli in Chickens and Urinary Tract Infections") show it can lead to urinary tract infection.

To protect the health and livelihood of your poultry farm, it's important to implement strict biosecurity measures.

### Causes of E. coli Infections

Possible causes of _E. coli_ infections in chickens include poor environmental conditions, overcrowding, other infections and improper transportation.

#### Poor Environmental Conditions

When poultry houses aren't properly [cleaned and sanitized](https://www.southlandorganics.com/blogs/poultry-biosecurity/poultry-house-sanitation "Poultry House Sanitation"), it can create the perfect environment for bacteria such as _E. coli_ to thrive.

#### Overcrowding

Overcrowding can cause stress in chickens, which can lead to weakened immune systems and an increased risk of disease transmission. _E. coli_ infections are commonly spread through fecal contamination and infected or contaminated eggs.

#### Other Infections

If the chickens are already battling another infection, such as infectious bronchitis virus, chickens' immune systems may also be weakened. When this occurs, the chickens are more susceptible to _E. coli_ infection.

#### Improper Transportation

Improperly transporting poultry can introduce the risk of contamination from other sources, such as wild birds, which increases the risk of infection.

### E. coli Symptoms

![Colibacillosis in chickens](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1678284628/Blog%20Images/Colibacillosis_in_chickens_navdcd.png)

Symptoms and clinical signs of _E. coli_ can vary. Birds with localized infections, or infections only affecting one part of the birds, are "usually under-sized, unthrifty and found along the edges of the house along walls or under feeders and waterers," according to Jackie Linden on the [The Poultry Site](https://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/colibacillosis-in-layers-an-overview "Symptoms of E. Coli in Chickens").

With more severe systemic infections, or infections in the bloodstream, birds are "often dull, lethargic and unresponsive when approached. Faecal material is often green with containing white-yellow urates due to anorexia and dehydration."

Monitoring birds for unusual behavior and symptoms can be vital to catching _E. coli_ infection before it spreads throughout the entire house.

### APEC and Colibacillosis

![Poultry house](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1678284628/Blog%20Images/Poultry_house_e515fc.png)

According to Kathayat, Lokesh, Ranjit and Rajashekara's [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8069529/ "Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli") in _Pathogens_ accessed through the National Library of Medicine, "The most common infections caused by APEC in chickens are perihepatitis, airsacculitis, pericarditis, egg peritonitis, salphingitis, coligranuloma, omphalitis, cellulitis and osteomyelitis/arthritis; these are commonly referred as avian colibacillosis."

APEC can infect poultry through a variety of entry points, including the respiratory tract, skin trauma, cloaca, damaged intestinal mucosa and navel, according to Dr. Lisa K. Nolan's [article](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/poultry/colibacillosis/colibacillosis-in-poultry "Colibacillosis in Poultry") in the _Merck Veterinary Manual_.

The bottom line: APEC causes colibacillosis, which is one of the most common poultry diseases across the world. While colibacillosis may be common, that doesn't mean it has to be common on your poultry farm.

What can you do to prevent APEC, and in turn, prevent colibacillosis, making sure it doesn't affect _your_ bottom line?

## The Natural Solution

We have frequent conversations with growers who are experiencing high mortality rates flock after flock. The common thought among these farmers is “I don’t know what else to do.” While there are many strategies for the treatment and prevention of _E. coli_, the vast majority entail some form of chemical application.

![Escherichia coli prevention](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1678284623/Blog%20Images/Escherichia_coli_prevention_gaj9ls.png)

At Southland Organics, we believe in natural solutions to natural problems. For _E. coli_ infections, our natural solution is [Litter Life](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/poultry-litter-amendment "E. Coli Prevention"). Completely safe to apply with birds present, this litter treatment contains indigenous bacteria and selectively adaptive microbiology, which have been proven effective in preventing _E. coli_ and other poultry diseases. Simply spraying the house floor is all it takes for nature to get to work. With Litter Life, you will achieve a drier floor, reduced ammonia and better overall litter quality, which are all preventive measures against _E. coli_ infections.

### How It Works

![Escherichia coli isolates not resistant to acids](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1650016987/Southland%20Website/MAC/Microbes.png)

Controlling harmful pathogens in a nutrient-rich environment like poultry litter requires a powerful solution that can truly dominate the biology present in the litter. Litter Life contains a consortium of bacteria that has been proven to effectively dominate harmful bacteria such as _E. coli_, _Campylobacter_ and many others. With Litter Life, the good bacteria pushes out the harmful bacteria, completely replacing them with beneficial strains.

The biology in Litter Life consists of a base made from an ancient cypress lignin deposit, which is high in natural carbon and humic and fulvic acids. Lignin has been shown to inhibit the growth of _E. coli_, _Salmonella_ and _Clostridium_ in several scientific studies. It inhibits the growth of bad bacteria without inhibiting the good bacteria present in Litter Life, such as _Bacillus subtilis_. Litter Life keeps working flock after flock, protecting your birds from harmful infectious diseases.

### Annihilate and Repopulate

![Healthy chickens](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1678284623/Blog%20Images/Healthy_chickens_ib79te.png)

In severe cases of _E. coli_ infection, we recommend the "annihilate and repopulate" strategy. This strategy is a combination of disinfecting and populating with beneficial biology for [competitive exclusion](https://www.southlandorganics.com/blogs/news/what-is-competitive-exclusion "Competitive Exclusion"). Disinfecting is a very temporary solution and often causes a much worse situation. When a poultry house is disinfected, it creates a biological vacuum that will soon be filled, most often, with the very same or worse bacteria. More often than not, the bad guys are the first ones back on the scene.

What can you do to make sure the bad bacteria don't take over again? After disinfecting, or annihilating, there's an important step: repopulation. Following disinfection, introduce the good bacteria by [applying Litter Life](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/poultry-litter-amendment "Litter Life Poultry Litter Amendment"). This strategy of applying Litter Life three to five days after disinfecting has shown great results in houses deemed to have severe _Escherichia coli_ infections.

An ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure. It's also less expensive! Low mortality and healthy poultry flocks mean one thing: higher profits.
