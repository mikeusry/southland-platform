The great news is that you can still achieve the benefits of conventional programs without the use of harmful chemicals through **humic acid-based lawn care**.

Here at Southland Organics, we provide natural solutions to natural problems in lawn and garden care. One natural problem that the impact-conscious homeowner regularly faces is how to grow a beautiful, lush lawn without harming the environment or endangering their family and pets. Our solution? Humic acid for lawns.

## What is humic acid?

![Humic and fulvic acid treatments](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1674676617/Blog%20Images/Humic_and_fulvic_acid_treatments_ti7zpw.png)

Humic acid is organic matter that makes up humus, the main organic fraction of soil. General benefits of humic acids include improving the soil's water holding capacity and nutrient retention, adding nutrient value to all soil types including clay and sandy soils, stimulating root growth, improving plant growth, boosting seed germination, improving soil structure and having a lower cost than other conventional soil products. Humic acid products can be found in both granular and liquid forms.

The best part? Humic acid lawn products are safe for people, pets and the planet. They don’t produce harmful runoff or add [unsafe chemicals](https://www.southlandorganics.com/blogs/news/17982096-health-effects-of-synthetic-fertilizer "Health Effects of Synthetic Fertilizer") to your lawn. Kids and pets can play on lawns treated with humic acid products, even if they’ve just been sprayed.

## **When to Apply Humic Acid to Your Lawn's Soil**

The spring or fall is the best time to apply humic acid to your lawn's soil. This allows the humic acid to work its magic during periods of active root growth and nutrient uptake. For optimal results, apply humic acid when the soil temperature is 55–80°F for maximum absorption by the roots.

Applying humic acid during the spring or fall helps improve soil quality, increases root development and enhances nutrient absorption, which all lead to a healthier, greener lawn.

Although spring and fall are the optimal times for most humic acids products, we have a variety of products that use humic and fulvic acid as carriers for microbial packages and fertilizers during the summer months.

## Fulvic Acid for Plants and Lawns

Fulvic acid, a key component of humic substances, plays a crucial role in plant and lawn health. It helps in nutrient uptake, improves soil structure, boosts seed germination and enhances overall plant growth. When used in combination with microbial packages and fertilizers, fulvic acid can further optimize the benefits for your lawn.

Fulvic acids, like humic acids, perform well in both alkaline soils and acidic soils. Most lawn products contain a combination of both humic and fulvic acids, making it unnecessary to distinguish between the two for DIY lawn care.

## Our Lawn Care Bundles

Because of the benefits of humic acid for lawns and the peace of mind it provides to users, we developed a simple [lawn care program](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/natural-lawn-care-subscription "Lawn Care Program") that includes four humate-based products: Genesis, Omega, FertALive and Revival.

![Improve both the soil health and grass health](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1674675975/Blog%20Images/Improve_both_the_soil_health_and_grass_health_q0dtrl.png)

These are all liquid humic acid products rather than granular humic acid products, and they’re designed to be diluted and sprayed on your lawn at different points in the growing season. Incorporating humic acid applications into your lawn care can increase root growth, stimulate beneficial microbes, reduce harmful microbes, and improve soil moisture retention. By using products like our lawn care bundles that harness the power of humates, you can ensure that your lawn receives the essential nutrients it needs to thrive.

We know that everyone’s lawn is different, so our program is customized by your turf zone and lawn size. Your turf zone is determined by where in the country you live and impacts the months in which you should apply lawn care products. Your lawn size is an approximate square footage that helps us determine the amount of product you need.

Take our [quick and easy quiz](https://www.videoask.com/fyahikle6 "Lawn Care Bundle Quiz") to find the right program for your lawn! At the end of the quiz, we’ll tell you which lawn care bundle is right for you. Add that bundle to your cart, and we’ll send you exactly what you need for the entire growing season.

### Step 1: Genesis

![Genesis increases soil carbon](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721081720/Blog%20Images/Genesis_increases_soil_carbon_xwonf7.png)

The first step is to apply [Genesis](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/genesis "Genesis Soil Conditioner"), our humic acid soil conditioner. It uses beneficial biology, organic acids and carbon to accelerate green-up and is scientifically proven to increase germination rate, soil quality and plant mass.

Through the biostimulants, Genesis accelerates root growth through oxygenation, chelates nutrients to make them accessible to the plant, combats negative fungal growth, aerates compacted soil and works to unlock previous fertilizer applications.

#### Application Rate

Genesis is applied in the spring to prepare your lawn for the hot summer by adding activated carbon and rich microbiology.

Apply 10–12 oz. of Genesis per thousand square feet in a sprayer, diluted at a 1:20 product to water ratio.

### Step 2: Omega + FertALive

![Adding humic acid](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1674675971/Blog%20Images/Adding_humic_acid_pfrjql.png)

The second step includes two products: [Omega](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/omega-soil-activator "Omega Soil Activator") and [FertALive](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/fertalive "FertALive Liquid Humic Acid Fertilizer").

In addition to its humate base, Omega includes a proprietary blend of beneficial bacteria that promotes nutrient uptake and builds grass that is resilient to disease and environmental stress. This helps lawns thrive throughout the summer heat.

FertALive is a powerful and effective humic acid lawn fertilizer. It is enhanced by Chilean nitrate, PSBs (phosphorus solubilizing bacteria), KSBs (potassium solubilizing bacteria) and liquid carbon. The PSBs and KSBs help release phosphorus and potassium that are already present in the soil, reducing the need for additional inputs. This stable and organic liquid humic concentrate provides a reliable source of nutrients, enhances conventional fertility programs and helps lawns meet their full quality potential. And if you have a garden or potted plants, FertALive will help them thrive too!

#### Application Rates

Omega and FertALive are applied together because they complement one another.

Apply 6–8 oz. of Omega per thousand square feet, diluted at a 1:20 product to water ratio. Apply 8 oz. of FertALive per thousand square feet, diluted at a 1:30 product to water ratio.

### Step 3: Revival

![Applying humic acid](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1674675969/Blog%20Images/Applying_humic_acid_icikol.png)

Once your grass has had a long summer in the sun, it needs to be revived during the fall. That’s why the product applied in our third step is called [Revival](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/turf-revival "Revival Liquid Lawn Aerator").

Revival is the ultimate microbial dethatcher, liquid aerator and compost accelerant. The blend of biologically active, organic carbon, organic acids and beneficial microbes revives turf to healthy and lush conditions at the end of the season. 

#### Application Rate

Apply 5–7 oz. of Revival per thousand square feet, diluted at a 1:20 product to water ratio.

## Green Grass Rooted in Healthy Soil

![Soil microbes](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1674675975/Blog%20Images/Soil_microbes_bljx4m.png)

Organic lawns are typically much safer for people, pets and the planet than lawns treated with synthetic chemicals. Humic acid is a great, natural option to grow a beautiful lawn without worrying about harming those who use the lawn—or the environment.

The key to a beautiful lawn is healthy soil. Healthy soil means healthy grass that is less susceptible to disease and weeds, and most importantly, beautiful and green. At Southland Organics, we treat the root of the problem by building healthy soil through products based on humic acids.
