October 12 is National Farmer’s Day. It's a time to honor the people whose hands and hearts sustain our nation. Farmers are the foundation of our food system, working tirelessly to feed families, nurture the land and fuel the economy.

At Southland Organics, we’re proud to support this vital community. From row crops to poultry houses, farmers embody the resilience, innovation and care that make American agriculture thrive.

## The Backbone of the Poultry Industry

Within the agricultural world, poultry growers play a vital but often overlooked role. While attention often goes to large integrators, it’s the 97% of family-owned farms that truly drive the poultry industry forward.

Together, these farms contribute to an industry valued at over $70 billion, supporting more than 2 million jobs and generating a total economic impact exceeding $660 billion. Their work is essential—not just to the food on our tables, but to the strength and security of our nation.

## The Importance of Farmers

As Jason Jackson reminds us, “A nation that can’t feed itself doesn’t control itself.” The ability to grow and produce food locally is central to our independence and wellbeing.

Every day, farmers across America demonstrate what it means to work hard, adapt and persevere. Their efforts build healthier communities, more sustainable ecosystems and a stronger future for everyone.

## Thank You from Southland Organics

This National Farmer’s Day, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to the farmers who feed, nurture and protect our nation. Your work is important, and we’re honored to stand behind you.

Happy National Farmer’s Day from all of us at Southland Organics!
