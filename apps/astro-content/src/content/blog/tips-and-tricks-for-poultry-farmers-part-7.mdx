The seventh edition of Tips and Tricks brings together practical reminders across several areas: pressure washing, insurance and electrical warning signs. You may already be familiar with some of these tips, but when it comes to safety and prevention, even familiar advice can make a big difference.

## Pressure Washing

\>We recently spoke with a grower in northern Alabama about pressure washing. Pressure washing is a normal part of life on the farm, but it’s also an area where avoidable accidents can happen. 

### Turn the Power Off First

First and foremost: turn the power off before you start pressure washing. Water and electricity don’t mix, and there have been serious incidents caused by skipping this step. Taking a few extra minutes to shut power down can prevent dangerous and costly mistakes.

### Reduce Dry Material Before Adding Water

Before firing up the pressure washer, consider removing as much dry material as possible.

-   Use a blower or mechanical cleaning first
    
-   Sweep or blow down dust, litter and debris
    

Why does this matter? Because the less water you introduce into the house, the better. Excess moisture:

-   Encourages bacteria growth
    
-   Slows down floor drying
    
-   Creates conditions you’ll have to manage later
    

### Consider Cleaning Aids to Improve Results

Some growers find it helpful to add mild cleaning agents to their wash water to help break down residue more effectively.

A few examples mentioned:

-   A small amount of dish soap
    
-   A simple ammonia-and-water mix for cleaning light bulbs
    

Always follow safe handling practices and use common sense, but these small additions can improve cleaning efficiency when used appropriately.

## Insurance

Insurance requirements are changing, and companies are actively looking for reasons to raise rates—or drop coverage altogether.

At the Sunbelt Ag Expo, we spoke with a grower who shared a practical approach:

-   Instead of paying for regular fire extinguisher service, they replace extinguishers every two years when they expire.
    
-   They also added extinguishers in areas not specifically required, like generator sheds, which helped demonstrate proactive risk management.
    

Bottom line: Talk with your insurance provider, ask questions and don’t assume the most expensive option is the only option. Small, proactive steps can help protect your coverage.

## Electrical Warning Signs

When it comes to electrical systems, prevention is always better than reaction. Here are four warning signs that deserve immediate attention:

### 1\. Frequent Breaker Trips or Blown Fuses

An occasional trip may not be unusual, but repeated issues point to a larger problem.

### 2\. Flickering or Dimming Lights

Especially if lights surge or behave inconsistently, this can signal wiring or load issues.

### 3\. Unexplained Equipment Shutdowns

If equipment shuts down or malfunctions without a clear cause, don’t ignore it.

### 4\. Visible Signs of Overheating

Burn marks, discoloration or heat damage around outlets or panels are red flags that something is wrong.

## Stay Focused on Prevention

None of these tips are complicated, but they matter. Sometimes the simplest reminders are the ones that keep things running smoothly. Paying attention to small warning signs, staying ahead of maintenance and making thoughtful decisions about cleaning and safety can save time, money and stress down the road.
