## Our Chicken Supplements

### [**Hen Helper**](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/hen-helper?_pos=1&_psq=hen%20helper&_ss=e&_v=1.0 "Hen Helper Poultry Probiotic")

#### Poultry probiotic for egg production!

![Hen Helper Poultry Probiotic](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1649793619/Product%20Images/Hen%20Helper%20Poultry%20Probiotic%20Quart.png)Hen Helper is a poultry probiotic chicken supplement that improves your hens’ health and nutrition. Its organic acids and carbon naturally tighten the birds’ gut, improving overall digestive function.

Hen Helper aids in nutrient and vitamin absorption, which improves shell quality and cleanliness so that you get firmer shells and healthier chicks. You can also expect improved egg production, since Hen Helper has been shown to keep hens in peak longer.

Additionally, all the good bacteria in this product helps chickens' digestive health, helps fight off bad bacteria that cause diseases and supports a balanced diet. Aside from these health benefits, Hen Helper can also help improve chicken feed conversion.

To use Hen Helper, add one teaspoon per gallon of your birds’ fresh drinking water at least once a week. Be sure not to use Hen Helper at the same time as vinegar or other disinfectants like Mother Load, as they might wipe out the beneficial microbes when mixed.  

### [**Litter Life**](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/poultry-litter-amendment?_pos=1&_psq=litter&_ss=e&_v=1.0 "Litter Life Coop Floor Amendment")

#### A healthy floor makes a healthy bird!

![Litter Life Coop Floor Conditioner](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1631806720/Product%20Images/Litter%20Life%20Poultry%20Litter%20Conditioner-Gallon.png)

A healthy coop floor grows a healthy bird. Litter Life is one of the first chicken supplements we sold. It adds organic acids and carbon to the ground of your coop, speeding up the natural breakdown of litter to give your birds a drier, healthier foundation.

It also adds beneficial microbes into the mix to help defend your birds against harmful bacteria that cause big issues, like enteritis and dermatitis. Litter Life also extends your bedding’s life and combats the strong odors that can hide in your coop.

To use Litter Life, first mix one pint of product with one gallon of water. This mixture can be applied with a sprayer to cover 250 square feet. Be sure to use all of the mixture within 24 hours. If you’re getting new chicks, we recommend applying Litter Life before placing your birds. You can also spray Litter Life with birds present! It won’t harm them at all.

### [**Catalyst- Liquid Formula**](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/liquid-catalyst-poultry-vitamin?_pos=2&_psq=cat&_ss=e&_v=1.0 "Liquid Formula Catalyst Poultry Vitamin")

#### No more vitamin and mineral deficiency!

![beneficial vitamins and minerals for chicken vitamins](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1639602887/Product%20Images/Catalyst_Liquid_Formula.png)

[Catalyst Poultry Vitamin supplement](https://www.southlandorganics.com/blogs/news/catalyst-liquid-chicken-vitamins "Catalyst Liquid Chicken Vitamins") is a complete multivitamin supplement for chickens. We originally sold a powder version for large-scale poultry farms, but now have a liquid formula specifically designed for backyard chicken keepers!

Catalyst maximizes the health and boosts the immune system of your flock. Birds that take Catalyst have better leg and bone development as well as cardiovascular health, skin health and blood health. Catalyst vitamin supplements come in a convenient, 8 oz. bottle that you can easily pour into your coop's waterers. 

Catalyst chicken vitamins include all the necessary water soluble vitamins and minerals to support an overall healthy immune system for chickens. Our vitamin supplement for chickens includes vitamins A, vitamin D 3, vitamin E, vitamin K 3, and Riboflavin, Folic Acid, Thiamine HCL, Biotin, d-Panthothenic Acid and ascorbic acid.

Vitamin supplements are necessary for complete nutrition for chickens, and a deficiency can significantly hurt overall health. Vitamin K helps birds’ bodies process Calcium and Vitamin D. It also promotes blood health.

Vitamin E is necessary for normal embryonic development in chickens, and thus is linked to healthy egg shells and production. Deficiencies in Vitamin B 12 are linked to reduced weight gain and feed intake and poor feather quality.

To use Catalyst, add one teaspoon of our liquid vitamins and minerals per gallon of your birds’ fresh drinking water once a week. If you’re growing new chicks, you can start them on Catalyst on day one. Then, apply it once per week.

You’ll get the best results when you use Catalyst alongside our Hen Helper Poultry Probiotic, which allows for maximum nutrient absorption. 

### [**Mother Load**](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/apple-cider-vinegar-for-chickens?_pos=1&_psq=mother%20load&_ss=e&_v=1.0 "Mother Load ACV and Garlic for Chickens")

#### Clean guts and butts!

![Mother Load ACV for Chickens](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1656445996/Product%20Images/ACV%20for%20poultry-2.5gallon.png)

We call our apple cider vinegar for poultry “Mother Load.” This is because it includes the “mother,” which is the element of vinegar that has the most health benefits. This product is raw, unfiltered and infused with powdered garlic. Birds love the taste of the vinegar and garlic mix, so they are happy to drink their water when Mother Load is in it.

Mother Load has antiviral and antibacterial properties, so promotes digestive health, and it helps increase immunity. On top of all that, the acetic acid bacteria is a probiotic, which means it has good bacteria that fights bad bacteria in the gut, helping prevent disease.

To use Mother Load, first be sure to shake the bottle well. Then, apply 1 tablespoon of Mother Load per gallon of clean drinking water once per week. If you have new chicks, run it on days one and two, and then run it about once per week.

Be sure NOT to run Mother Load at the same time as other products, like Hen Helper, since Mother Load might wipe out their beneficial microbes when they are mixed.

### [**Desecticide**](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/darkling-beetle-insecticide?_pos=1&_psq=desect&_ss=e&_v=1.0 "Desecticide Chicken Mite Spray")

#### Kill chicken mites on contact!

![product to kill chicken mites](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1646848170/Product%20Images/Desecticide_Gallon.png)Bugs like [chicken mites](https://www.southlandorganics.com/blogs/news/how-to-get-rid-of-chicken-mites) can prove to be a threat to your flock, and handling them in a safe, responsible way can be challenging. Desecticide kills resistant darkling beetles, lesser mealworms, bed bugs, mites, fleas and ticks on poultry without the use of toxic chemicals.

It can be used during any bird growth stage, and bugs do not build resistance to it. It’s also safe to use around pets, children and your garden!

To use Desecticide, apply 6 ounces per ½ gallon of water. When mixing, start with the water first, and then add in Desecticide. If you add the water to the Desecticide instead, you will get a foam. No need for agitation- just mix and spray every three to four weeks. This mixture covers 250 square feet. 

### [Backyard Poultry Bundle](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/backyard-poultry-bundle-chicken-supplements "backyard poultry bundle")

#### Complete Backyard Chicken Nutrition

![backyard poultry nutrition products](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1656448625/Product%20Images/Backyard%20Poultry%20Bundle.png)

For regular backyard coop care, we recommend our Backyard Poultry Bundle. It includes one quart of Hen Helper poultry probiotic, one gallon of Mother Load ACV + garlic and one bottle of our Catalyst Poultry Vitamin liquid formula.

Buying these three products together in our Backyard Poultry Bundle saves 23% compared to purchasing the same products separately. While Desecticide and Litter Life are used on a more as-needed basis, the three products in our Backyard Poultry Bundle are applicable year-round for complete chicken nutrition.

### Natural supplements for free range chickens!

All of our products can be given to baby chicks as well as adult chickens. Feeding chickens these natural supplements increases the nutritional value of their water, fulfilling their nutritional needs and helping prevent various health issues like dirty eggs and digestion problems.

These products can all be used as a free choice supplement when added to coop waterers and complement any other supplements you may give, like black oil sunflower seeds, flax seeds or homemade treats.
