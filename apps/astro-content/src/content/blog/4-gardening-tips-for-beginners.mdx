Hello springtime! Now that we're starting to see warmer weather, it’s time to dig in and start planning the anticipated spring garden.

Here are some beginner gardening tips to make sure you're on your way to the best spring garden in the neighborhood.

-   **Clean out the garden.** Get rid of any weeds and remove debris. Garden clean-up should also include maintenance of the compost pile.
-   **Revitalize the soil.** Your soil is likely dried out and it may be thirsty. You should also think about adding an organic soil conditioner or fertilizer to increase the health of the soil and improve the life of your plants.
-   **Prune old plants** that may have lasted after the winter season to make way for fresh spring growth.
-   Once you have cleaned up your garden, it is time to put your attention to **new plants or shrubs**. Use local wisdom to guide your planning process. Many local extension offices have charts with recommended planting dates and spacing.
