Electrical systems are easy to overlook—until something goes wrong. From overloaded circuits to overheated breakers, small issues can quickly turn into major problems if they aren’t caught early.

After a conversation with longtime customer and distributor Jamie Fields, who regularly installs and services technology inside poultry houses, seven electrical best practices stood out as especially important for growers.  

## 1\. Get an Electrical Inspection Before Upgrades

Before completing an energy audit, adding equipment or making upgrades requested by an integrator, start with a professional electrical inspection.

Many growers qualify for upgrades or incentives, but the existing electrical system may not be able to handle the added load, such as moving from a one-horsepower motor to a one-and-a-half-horsepower motor. An inspection helps answer a critical question before changes are made: Can my system actually handle this?

## 2\. Schedule Routine Electrical Inspections

Electrical inspections shouldn’t only happen before upgrades. They should also be part of routine maintenance!

Think of it like a yearly physical. Over time, breakers wear out and lose their ability to function properly. Catching issues early helps prevent failures at the worst possible time. For many growers, the cost is relatively small compared to the potential loss.

## 3\. Check Your Main Breaker

Main breakers wear out just like smaller ones, but they’re often harder to replace quickly.

In some cases, main breakers have failed during peak summer conditions, leading to serious disruptions. It’s worth asking an electrical professional how often your main breaker should be evaluated or replaced based on its age and usage.

## 4\. Put an A/C Unit in Your Control Room

Heat is the number one enemy of electronics.

High ambient temperatures combined with electrical load can shorten the life of breakers, computers and controllers. Installing a small air conditioning unit in control rooms helps keep temperatures down and protects sensitive equipment. As a bonus, it also gives growers a safe place to cool down and recover during extreme heat.

Simple temperature gauges can be added to breakers to show when overheating occurs. These indicators change color if a breaker exceeds a certain temperature range, offering a visual warning sign. Even if everything seems to be running fine, discoloration is a red flag that replacement should be considered before failure occurs.

## 5\. Verify Your Backup System is Working & Set

Backup systems are only helpful if they’re properly set and working.

If a controller fails and the backup thermostat or system isn’t accurate, the result can be serious problems inside the house. Regularly verify that backups are correctly calibrated and ready to take over if needed, just like you would with a generator.

## 6\. Clean Your Generator Shed

Generator sheds often become catch-all storage areas, but clutter can slow down critical repairs when time matters most.

Keeping the area clean ensures quick access during emergencies.

## 7\. Get a Generator Service with a Maintenance Company

Working with a generator service company may be worth the investment. During widespread outages or severe weather, service contract customers are often prioritized—something that can make all the difference at 3:00 a.m.

## Final Thoughts on Electrical Maintenance

Electrical systems don’t usually fail without warning, but those warnings are easy to miss if inspections and maintenance are ignored.

Staying proactive with inspections, heat management, backup verification and generator readiness can help prevent costly downtime and protect both equipment and birds.
