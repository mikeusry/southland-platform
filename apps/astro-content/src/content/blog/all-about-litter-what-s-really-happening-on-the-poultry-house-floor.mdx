When it comes to raising healthy birds, few things are as important—or as misunderstood—as litter. Many outside the poultry industry think “chicken litter” simply means manure, but those who work with birds every day know it’s much more than that.

Litter is a mix of bedding material, feathers, manure, dirt and other organic matter. It’s the foundation birds live on and also one of the biggest challenges producers face when managing performance and flock health.

## The Science Behind Litter: Composting in the House

Inside every poultry house, composting is happening around the clock. Because litter isn’t removed daily, the material breaks down naturally, just like a compost pile, through a balance of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.

For ideal composting, the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio should be around 25:1 to 28:1. But in most poultry houses, nitrogen levels are too high due to manure, and it’s difficult to achieve that balance. Bedding helps by adding carbon, but oxygen is often the missing piece. Without enough oxygen, litter becomes compacted and anaerobic, setting the stage for harmful bacterial growth.

## The Challenge of Today’s Antibiotic-Free Environment

Since the industry’s move toward antibiotic-free (ABF) production, litter management has become even more critical. A warm, moist poultry house creates what’s essentially a petri dish for bacteria. Without antibiotics to suppress bacterial loads, issues like dermatitis, necrotic enteritis and _E. coli_ can become major problems.

Some growers report high mortality, while others have acceptable survival but poor performance. Why? Because when birds are constantly challenged by bad bacteria, they divert energy from growth toward immune defense. The result: feed conversion suffers and birds “survive” rather than thrive.

## Why Conventional Litter Treatments Fall Short

Many litter amendments target surface issues like pH or disinfection. While these may temporarily control ammonia or bacteria, they only affect the top layer of litter.

The real problem lies several inches below the surface, where harmful bacteria like _Clostridium_ thrive. These bacteria can persist for flock after flock, causing ongoing performance and health challenges that surface-level treatments can’t touch.

## How Litter Life Works: A Biological Approach

![Litter Life Poultry Litter Amendment](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0794/9519/files/LitterLife_2.5gal_z1ushv.png)

[Litter Life](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/poultry-litter-amendment "Litter Life Poultry Litter Amendment") takes a different approach by addressing the root cause of litter challenges: unbalanced biology. It introduces 14 strains of beneficial bacteria, including _Bacillus subtilis_, known for its effectiveness against _Clostridium_. These microbes work their way deep into the litter and the pad, helping outcompete harmful bacteria and restore balance to the environment.

Litter Life provides highly activated carbon to improve the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and fulvic acid to add oxygen throughout the litter. This combination supports aerobic (oxygen-loving) bacterial activity, leading to a healthier, drier floor.

### Managing Ammonia the Right Way

Ammonia management is often top of mind for growers—and for good reason. High ammonia levels can cause blindness in chicks and respiratory issues in older birds. Traditional acid-based treatments lower pH temporarily, but once birds begin excreting waste and the pH begins to rise, ammonia levels quickly rebound.

Litter Life works differently. It gases off ammonia naturally by improving composting and carbon balance. While growers may notice a temporary spike in ammonia within the first 24 hours after application, levels then begin to drop and stay lower over time, helping maintain better air quality for both birds and workers.

### Oxygen: The Overlooked Key to Dry Floors

A well-oxygenated litter bed not only supports beneficial bacteria but also helps maintain a dry floor. Thanks to the oxygen-rich fulvic acid in Litter Life, floors stay noticeably drier. This is a key factor in preventing disease and improving bird comfort.

In fact, many growers’ first observation after using Litter Life is: _“It sure keeps a dry floor.”_ That’s no coincidence! It’s a direct result of healthier aerobic activity in the litter.

### Building a Healthier Floor for Healthier Birds

Every time birds peck at spilled feed, they’re also interacting with the microbes living in their litter. A floor dominated by bad bacteria challenges their immune systems while one rich in beneficial bacteria supports gut health and performance.

Although it’s impossible to eliminate every harmful organism, continually feeding and populating good bacteria helps tip the balance toward a stronger, healthier environment flock after flock.

## The Bottom Line

Litter management isn’t just about reducing ammonia or keeping things dry. It’s about creating the right microbial balance to support your birds’ health and performance.

By improving oxygen levels, balancing carbon and nitrogen and introducing beneficial bacteria deep into the litter, Litter Life helps growers move from managing problems to promoting lasting flock health.
