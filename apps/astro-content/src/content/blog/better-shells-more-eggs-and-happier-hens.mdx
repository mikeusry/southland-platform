[Hen Helper](https://www.southlandorganics.com/collections/backyard-birds/products/hen-helper "Hen Helper") probiotic for hens is an effective way to increase your hens' health, nutrition and fertility. It uses biologically active, organic carbon and beneficial microbes, also known as probiotics, to help your hens produce higher quality eggs and have better overall health.

Watch this video to learn more about how Hen Helper works and its benefits, like:

Hen Helper strengthens your birds from within! To start helping your hens, all you have to do is pour half an ounce of Hen Helper into 3 gallons of your birds’ fresh drinking water. If you don’t need that much, our rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon per gallon.‍ 

We recommend giving birds Hen Helper once a week, at minimum. You can administer it daily, as needed. Just be sure not to use Hen Helper at the same time as vinegar or other disinfectants, as they can wipe out the beneficial microbes and their bacteria-fighting benefits.
