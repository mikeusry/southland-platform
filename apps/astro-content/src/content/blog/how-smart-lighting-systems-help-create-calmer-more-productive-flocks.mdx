If there are two topics in poultry production that spark the most debate, they’re water and lighting. While lighting is often treated as a basic utility—something that simply helps birds see—it is actually one of the most powerful environmental factors in the poultry house. From stress and behavior to feeding patterns and gut health, lighting plays a much bigger role than many growers realize.

This importance was recently highlighted in the article [“Smarter Lighting, Calmer Flocks”](https://www.canadianpoultrymag.com/smarter-lighting-calmer-flocks/ "Smarter Lighting Calmer Flocks") by Melanie Epp in _Canadian Poultry_, which explored how lighting decisions directly influence bird comfort, behavior and overall welfare.

## Lighting Is More Than Visibility

Lighting isn’t just about whether birds can see feed pans or drinker lines. It shapes how birds behave, how they eat and how comfortable they feel in their environment. As outlined in _Canadian Poultry_, lighting is one of the most influential environmental drivers in a poultry house, affecting stress levels and flock stability.

Different growers—and even different houses within the same complex—often use different lighting schedules. While integrators may provide guidelines, the real impact comes from how lighting is managed day to day.

## Birds Are More Sensitive to Light Than Humans

Birds detect light very differently than people do. They are more sensitive to flicker, wavelength and intensity, meaning issues that may go unnoticed by humans can still cause agitation for birds.

Improper lighting can increase bird agitation and disrupt normal behaviors, leading to piling, uneven movement and feeding challenges.

## Stress: The Biggest Lighting-Related Risk

Among all the factors influenced by lighting, stress is the most significant. Stress affects nearly every system in the bird’s body, especially the gut. When birds experience prolonged stress, gut integrity can be compromised, increasing susceptibility to disease, reducing nutrient absorption, and ultimately impacting performance.

Both research and field experience highlighted in Melanie Epp's article show that calmer lighting environments contribute to calmer birds, supporting better welfare and more consistent performance.

## Practical Lighting Guidelines for Poultry Houses

Practical lighting guidelines for poultry houses include using gradual light transitions, reducing flicker, considering light spectrum, maintaining schedule consistency and keeping bulbs clean and replaced.

### Use Gradual Light Transitions

Sudden changes from dark to light (or vice versa!) can startle birds and increase stress. Gradual transitions, often achieved with dimmers or carefully timed schedules, help birds adjust more comfortably and reduce agitation.

### Reduce Flicker

Many poultry houses use LED lighting for energy efficiency, but some LEDs can flicker in ways birds detect easily. Minimizing flicker is a key takeaway from recent lighting research and helps reduce unnecessary stress.

### Consider Light Spectrum

Different light spectrums can influence bird behavior and physiology. While the optimal spectrum may vary, it’s worth discussing spectrum options with lighting suppliers when installing or upgrading systems.

### Maintain Schedule Consistency

Consistency matters. While lighting schedules may change as birds age, frequent or irregular adjustments can disrupt biological rhythms. Stable, predictable schedules help birds remain calm and settled.

### Keep Bulbs Clean and Replaced

Dirty or burned-out bulbs create uneven lighting across the house, which can affect bird distribution and behavior. Routine maintenance ensures uniform lighting and supports flock comfort.

## Small Changes, Big Impact

Smarter lighting isn’t about overcomplicating systems. It’s about understanding how birds experience light. Thoughtful lighting management can reduce stress, support gut health and improve overall flock welfare.

By focusing on consistency, maintenance and bird comfort, growers can use lighting as a tool to support calmer, healthier flocks.
