Managing [mortality](https://www.southlandorganics.com/blogs/poultry-biosecurity/poultry-farmers-options-for-managing-mortality "Poultry Farmers' Options for Managing Mortality") is an unavoidable part of poultry production, but how growers handle it continues to evolve. In a conversation with Chad Brubaker of [Innovative Poultry Products, LLC](https://innovativepoultryproducts.com/index.html "Innovative Poultry Products, LLC") at the Sunbelt Ag Expo, we took a closer look at dehydration rendering—an increasingly popular option for handling poultry mortality efficiently, cleanly and sustainably.

With changing labor dynamics, environmental expectations and operational demands, dehydration systems are gaining attention as a practical alternative to traditional composting. Chad shared why his team saw the need to innovate and how their dehydrator was designed to meet the real-world needs of poultry farmers.

## From Poultry Hawk to Dehydration Rendering

Innovative Poultry Products is already well known for the Poultry Hawk, a system designed to simplify dead bird removal. Through years of working closely with growers, the team gained firsthand experience with the challenges surrounding mortality handling and disposal.

That exposure led them to a key realization: dehydration rendering is where the market is heading. While existing options were available, Chad explained that many systems lacked innovation and practicality. Rather than adapting to what was already on the market, his team decided to design and build a [dehydrator](https://innovativepoultryproducts.com/mortality-disposal.html "Dehydrator") from the ground up, entirely in South Carolina.

## Why Dehydration Is Gaining Ground

Several factors are driving the shift toward dehydration rendering:

-   **Labor simplicity:** Unlike composting, dehydration is a push-button process that delivers consistent results.
    
-   **Environmental considerations:** Dehydration produces a clean exhaust, kills pathogens and significantly reduces odors, flies and scavengers.
    
-   **Consistency and reliability:** The process works the same way every time, regardless of staffing or weather conditions.
    

As Chad explained, dehydration removes much of the variability and complexity that can make composting challenging.

## Turning Mortality into a Useful Byproduct

One of the most compelling aspects of dehydration rendering is what remains after the process is complete. Instead of waste, the result is a dry, protein-rich material.

This byproduct can be:

-   Applied to fields as fertilizer
    
-   Used as a soil amendment
    
-   Repurposed as a protein source for cattle feed
    

What was once a cost and liability becomes a reusable resource, closing the loop and improving overall farm sustainability.

## What Makes This Dehydrator Different

Innovative Poultry Products focused heavily on building a machine that is both effective and practical for growers. Key design features include:

-   **Integrated bone crushers** that break down material during processing, improving the quality and usability of the final product
    
-   **Dynavac fan system** that pulls air through the unit and exhausts cleaner air, reducing buildup and maintenance
    
-   **Serviceable, reliable construction** designed to run smoothly and be easily maintained on the farm
    

These features aren’t just technical upgrades. They’re meant to reduce downtime, improve cleanliness and simplify day-to-day operation.

### Installation and On-Farm Setup

Another advantage of the system is flexibility. The dehydrator can be placed in a variety of locations, ideally under a shed for protection, with a wall positioned to allow material to dump cleanly on one side and be removed from the other.

The goal is simple access: easy loading, easy clean-out and minimal disruption to existing farm layouts.

## Looking Ahead: Why This Matters

Consumer expectations, environmental pressure and on-farm efficiency are all shaping the future of poultry production. Dehydration rendering addresses these concerns head-on, offering a low-odor, low-labor and environmentally conscious solution to mortality management.

As Chad noted, when growers compare the appearance, smell and consistency of dehydration systems to traditional compost sheds, the choice becomes clearer.
