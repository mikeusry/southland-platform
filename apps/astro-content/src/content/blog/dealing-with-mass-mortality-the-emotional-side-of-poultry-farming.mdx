## A Conversation Many Don’t Want to Have

In agriculture, there are plenty of topics people avoid—especially the ones that are uncomfortable, emotional or misunderstood. Mass mortality is one of those topics. While much of the industry focuses on protocols, equipment and logistics, there’s another side that doesn’t get talked about enough: how it affects growers personally.

This conversation isn’t about how to manage mortality inside the poultry house. It’s about how growers deal with it themselves.

## When Mass Mortality Becomes Reality

Mass mortality events—often tied to outbreaks like avian influenza—can turn life upside down for growers and their families. Quarantines, isolation, government protocols and the sheer scale of loss create a level of stress most people never experience.

Growers may suddenly find themselves unable to leave their property, unsure how long the situation will last and responsible for navigating complex requirements involving workers, equipment and disposal methods. Even when clear protocols exist, the experience itself can be overwhelming.

### The Emotional Impact on Growers and Families

One of the most significant (and least discussed) effects of mass mortality is the emotional toll it takes. Farming demands resilience, and many growers pride themselves on being tough. But toughness doesn’t eliminate emotional strain.

Repeated loss, isolation and uncertainty can wear down even the strongest individuals. Families feel it too, as daily routines are disrupted and stress levels remain high for extended periods of time.

## A Story That Still Resonates

Back in 2014, Shanon, a poultry farmer in Georgia, was dealing with [severe dermatitis](https://www.southlandorganics.com/blogs/poultry-biosecurity/grower-spotlight-shanons-story "Shanon's Story") in his birds. He experienced repeated losses flock after flock and eventually reached a breaking point—not just financially, but mentally and emotionally.

At the suggestion of several people, he tried one more flock and saw the same results. He knew if this happened once more, he would have nothing left. He knew his farm wouldn't make it, and neither would his stamina. That moment highlighted something important: there are limits, and ignoring them doesn’t make them disappear. After an intensive clean out and treatment with [Litter Life](https://www.southlandorganics.com/collections/poultry/products/poultry-litter-amendment), his next flock survived. Fifteen months later, he had not had any recurrence of dermatitis. 

## Why the Emotional Toll Is Often Minimized

Growers often feel pressure to “push through” and keep going. On top of that, public perception can add another layer of strain. Many consumers don’t see the daily care growers provide or understand the responsibility they carry.

Taking care of animals day after day, then facing sudden and widespread loss, is deeply personal. Minimizing that emotional impact only makes recovery harder.

### Recognizing the Warning Signs

Emotional fatigue doesn’t always show up clearly. It can look like exhaustion, detachment, loss of motivation or simply feeling numb. When willpower is drained, decision-making and resilience suffer—and that can make an already difficult situation worse.

These signs don’t just apply to owners. Employees and family members involved in day-to-day operations may be struggling too.

## Supporting Yourself and Your Team

Acknowledging emotional strain is not a weakness. It’s a necessary step toward dealing with it. Sometimes the best support is as simple as time away, rest or an honest conversation.

Mental and physical recovery go hand in hand. Eating well, sleeping well and stepping away when possible help replenish energy and perspective. Willpower is an exhaustible resource, and it needs to be refueled.

### A Problem Recognized Is a Problem Half Solved

One guiding principle applies here: a problem well defined is half solved. Ignoring emotional impact doesn’t make it go away. Recognizing it allows growers to respond intentionally rather than react out of exhaustion or frustration.

Every grower will face mortality at some point. The key is not pretending it doesn’t affect you, but dealing with it honestly and constructively.
