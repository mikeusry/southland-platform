Litter Life improves your birds’ health from the ground up! To apply Litter Life, just mix 1 pint of Litter Life with 1 gallon of water and then apply with a sprayer. This will cover up to 250 square feet.

We recommend applying Litter Life one week before you place your birds. If you’ve already placed your birds, apply Litter Life on your built-up litter before adding new bedding.
