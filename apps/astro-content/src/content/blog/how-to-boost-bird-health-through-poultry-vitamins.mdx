The majority of time and effort is spent on the poultry diet, where most of the emphasis is placed on feed. Often, the levels of vitamins in the flock's diet are directly related to the calculated feed allotment managed by the integrator or farmer. This plays an important role in optimizing a flock because birds are limited to naturally occurring vitamins from free-range activities.

With vitamins in poultry feed, the predominant focus is placed on fat-soluble vitamins. The fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K are stored for long periods of time. If there is not a balanced correlation with the water-soluble vitamins, then a higher risk of imbalance, poor performance and toxicity may occur.

When birds get a proper balance of fatty acids, amino acids, water-soluble vitamins and fat-soluble vitamins, the immune system is greatly strengthened, and the immune response to diseases and other challenges is increased. If you're seeking to improve the health of your broiler chickens, game birds, turkey or laying hens, add Catalyst to your bird supplies!

From vitamin E to folic acid, Catalyst is packed with essential vitamins for bird nutrition. Here's a complete list of the vitamins found in Catalyst: Vitamin E Supplement, Vitamin A Supplement, Ascorbic Acid, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (source of Vitamin K), Vitamin D3 Supplement, Biotin Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Thiamine Hydrochloride, Folic Acid.

## How to Apply

Catalyst Poultry Vitamin is a highly absorbable powder that is easy to apply. Using the scoop packaged with the vitamins, add 2 scoops of Catalyst into 5 gallons of stock solution for a medicator bucket set at a 1:128 ratio. Another rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon per 5 gallons of fresh drinking water.

Start chicks on Catalyst on day 1, running for 1–2 days. (Yes, it's completely safe—and actually recommended—that chicks receive Catalyst on day 1!) Then, run Catalyst once per week for 24 hours. For best results, run Catalyst with [Big Ole Bird Poultry Probiotics](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/poultry-probiotic "Big Ole Bird Poultry Probiotics").
