Are you tired of seeing weeds overtaking your farm? [Torched](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/torched-all-natural-weed-killer "Torched Weed Killer") is a powerful weed killer designed to effectively kill weeds without the use of toxic chemicals.  

### Non-Selective and Highly Effective

Made from a proprietary blend of oils and soaps, Torched works by sticking to the leaf of the plant and burning—that’s how it got its name! This prevents photosynthesis and halts growth, which eventually kills the plant! Additionally, Torched does not harm the soil, ensuring that your garden remains healthy and fertile.

### Safe for Your Personnel and Your Birds

Derived from natural ingredients that are generally regarded as safe, Torched is classified as a FIFRA 25-B Exempt pesticide. This designation allows you to spray around your poultry houses without the need to hire a specialist or get an applicators license.

If you are an organic farm, Torched will most likely be acceptable under your certifier. This also means that it is safe for you, your birds, your family, your pets and your personnel when used as directed.

### Torched vs. DIY Weed Killers

Vinegar and acetic acid, common ingredients in DIY weed killers, should only be used under specific safety precautions. Vinegar is a great multipurpose product, but regular white vinegar solution is typically too weak to do much damage to unwanted grass and weeds. While 5% vinegar can work, 8% vinegar or higher is needed to really make an effective weed killer. High percentage vinegar should be dealt with extreme caution, and you should always wear protective gear. Boiling water is simple, but it requires more time and risk than spraying a concentrate like Torched.

These natural weed control methods do little to keep those unwanted weeds at bay and can cost a lot of time, money and added risk. That's where Torched comes in.

### How to Use Torched

Spraying is simple! Shake well and mix eight to 10 ounces of Torched per gallon of water. For hardy weeds, mix 10 to 12 ounces of Torched per gallon of water.

Pour the diluted mixture into your sprayer of choice and apply to any problem plants on a warm, dry day.

Torched requires heat to be fully effective, so we recommend spraying when it is above 60° F to see the best results.

Re-treat hard-to-kill weeds after five to seven days if Torched does not eliminate all the weeds on the initial spray.
