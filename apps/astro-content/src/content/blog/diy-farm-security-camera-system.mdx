We are passionate about biosecurity—but today, we are zooming out from microscopic security to take a look at the big picture—**the overall security of your farm.** A key way to protect your birds is to know what is happening on your farm at all times, but security camera systems and services can be expensive.

In this video, poultry farmer, Jason Jackson, shares how farmers can install and monitor security camera systems themselves for just a fraction of the cost. He walks through the step-by-step process that saved him money and helped him gain peace of mind by setting up and managing video surveillance on his farm without hiring an expensive security company.

Security matters on the farm because you, as the farmer, need to know when people come onto or leave your farm, when deliveries happen, who is in your control room and how business is handled when you are away. Camera systems give you the ability to manage farm operations with even more certainty.

**First, let's take a look at what you'll need:**

-   Security Camera System (ebay or Amazon)
-   DVR with hard drive installed (may come with system)
-   WiFi Extender (ebay or Amazon)
-   Monitor (pawn / thrift shop)
-   VGA Cable and Mouse (may come with monitor)

Set up notifications to go directly to your phone, and check your actual monitor if and when you have concerns. These simple tools come together to heighten security all over your farm and help you sleep better at night.

**Next, let's talk installation.**

Consider the most important indoor and outdoor spots for your video cameras.

If a camera is outside, even if it says it is outdoor safe and water resistant, try to install it under an overhang for extra protection. If a camera is inside, be sure you can see as much of the indoor space as possible and that it includes most important areas like controls as well as entrances and exits.

**Where should you put your cameras?**

You should know who comes onto or leaves your property at any moment, so be sure to install a camera facing **your entry/exit road** as well as **outside your houses**.

You should also know who is in **your control room** at any point. We all know your flocks depend on a careful balance that is managed in this important space. You need to know who is making changes and when.

You also need to have cameras facing **feed bin pad** to know which bins were filled and when.

Monitoring equipment storage buildings is especially important because it's an area where thieves can come in. Monitoring can help you should anything turn up missing on your farm.

**Security is always the goal.**

We want to help you, the farmer, create as secure of a farm as possible.
