Today, we’re diving into the world of quail farming with John Tuck of Tuck Farms. Here’s what John had to share with Jason Jackson about the challenges, rewards and opportunities in this growing niche.

## How Quail Farming Works

Quail farming shares some common ground with chicken farming but comes with unique demands. John explains that his farm is fully integrated, meaning they handle everything from raising pullets and breeders to incubation, chick placement and ongoing animal care.

Unlike large-scale chicken operations that process and sell birds in bulk, Tuck Farms customizes orders, working directly with individual clients across the Southeast, Midwest and Texas. The team at Tuck Farms takes biosecurity seriously, transporting birds with their own drivers and trucks while ensuring proper sanitation practices to protect their flock.

## Rewards and Challenges of Quail Farming

For John, one of the biggest rewards of quail farming is the independence it offers. While farming has its demands, it also comes with the freedom to set your own schedule, balancing the responsibilities of the job with personal flexibility. He finds joy in the process, from incubation to raising chicks and ultimately satisfying his customers with a high-quality product.

Quail farming is a rewarding challenge. With limited resources and time, John and his team work hard to nurture each bird, helping it grow to maturity. This hands-on approach and the satisfaction of delivering a strong, healthy quail keep him passionate about his work.

## Who Buys Quail?

Unlike broiler chickens, which are raised primarily for meat, quail from Tuck Farms are bred for their athletic qualities, meant to retain a wild nature that mimics the quail populations once abundant in the Southeast. This trait makes them ideal for shooting preserves—where, as John explains, about 99% of his birds end up. Many of these birds will eventually be processed for food, but they serve a purpose before then, providing hunters and bird dog trainers with a natural hunt-like experience.

## Getting Into the Quail Business

Starting a quail farming business can be challenging, John advises, but it’s possible to repurpose existing poultry barns to save on initial costs. Retrofitting older chicken barns to accommodate quail is one way he’s found to make the transition easier.

To newcomers, John suggests a hands-on approach. Start small by buying eggs or a small incubator, hatch some chicks and see what the local market holds. For those with a love for bird dogs or an interest in niche farming, the quail industry presents a unique opportunity. Building relationships with customers, delivering quality birds and maintaining a good reputation can open doors to steady growth in this niche.
