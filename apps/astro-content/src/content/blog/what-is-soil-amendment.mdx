What is a soil amendment? Southland Organics' Evan Gill explains the difference between fertilizers and soil amendments.

## Soil Amendments

-   Don’t add concentrated nutrients to the soil but actually improve the texture
-   Can be both organic or inorganic
-   Modify the soil structure
-   Rebuild soils which have been damaged by improper management
-   Mixed into topsoil to promote healthy plant growth

## Fertilizers

-   Concentrated nutrient amounts added to the soil for a direct plant growth influence
-   Do not help soil's texture
-   Have a balanced ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium available to plants after application
-   Supply nutrients such as proteins and carbohydrates
-   May be chemically manufactured ([synthetic fertilizer](https://www.southlandorganics.com/blogs/news/17982096-health-effects-of-synthetic-fertilizer "Synthetic Fertilizers Disadvantages and Health Effects")) or created from plant and animal products (natural fertilizer)

Products such as [Jump Start Soil Conditioner](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/jump-start-soil-conditioner "Organic Soil Conditioner") and [Genesis Lawn Soil Conditioner](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/genesis "Lawn Soil Conditioner") rebuild soils rapidly and are not considered fertilizers.
