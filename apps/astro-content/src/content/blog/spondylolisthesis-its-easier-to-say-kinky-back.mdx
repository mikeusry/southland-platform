From Newcastle to Mareks, dermatitis to LT, there are a number of diseases or challenges that can affect poultry—that is no secret. Kinky Back seems to be one that everyone has a harder time understanding, and we can see why. Everyone has their own way of explaining exactly what this disease is. Spondylolisthesis is the technical name and humans can actually suffer from it as well. This is a condition of the spine where one of the vertebrae moves more than it should and slips out of place. 

In birds, however, there are two forms of Kinky Back—both of which cause swelling and compression of the sixth thoracic vertebra. This specific vertebra is extremely important for motor function as it is the only one not fused to a neighboring vertebrae and able to move freely. Swelling at this junction in extreme cases causes posterior paralysis and even death. 

To put it simply, the same way to prevent issues in our own body works on your birds too! Good nutrition and healthy bacteria make a world of difference in the early stages of a grow out. To help with structural issues, make sure your birds are getting a good nutritional foundation those first 10 days. If you want to prepare for a bacterial challenge, make sure the birds' microbiome, bacteria and environment are a healthy and thriving system ready to take on any challenge.
