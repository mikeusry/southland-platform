What is one thing you never want to think about but are grateful to have when you need it? INSURANCE. This week we had the opportunity to talk to Kyle Russell from the Cole Agency. Kyle specializes in agriculture insurance policies, where he is able to help growers like you take care of their farms. 

Kyle and Allen spent some time covering topics like: 

1.  Loss of Income Insurance 
2.  On and Off Premises Equipment Insurance 
3.  Damage Coverages 

Insurance can be a real pain in the tail feathers, but it’s necessary to protect your living, breathing investment. Watch this video to learn more.
