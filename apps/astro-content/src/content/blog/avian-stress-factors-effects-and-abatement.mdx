“Chill out, don’t stress!”

Has anyone ever said that to you? Have you ever told that to your birds? There are numerous things that can cause stress in your birds. Heat, light, overcrowding, [ventilation](https://www.southlandorganics.com/blogs/poultry-biosecurity/poultry-house-ventilation-maintenance-pulleys-and-belts "Poultry House Ventilation"), noise, fear, lack of food, nutritional deficiencies, disease, infection and on and on. In this video, we take a look at two distinct types of stress and their impact on your birds.  

Stress is a physiological, biological or psychological response to a demanding situation, or stressor. Stressors are stimuli that disrupt homeostasis. In other words, stress comes from change. We even see that in our own life. The better you handle change, the better your stress response. Your birds are no different! From hatch to catch, your birds are dealing with change constantly.

Until next time, DON’T STRESS. Keep those birds chill.
