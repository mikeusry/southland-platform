## **Understanding Humic Acid**

![Humic acid for lawns](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1703274721/Blog%20Images/Humic_acid_for_lawns_rlelm5.png)

Humic acid, a natural option for soil health, offers essential benefits for improving soil health and thus, lawn health. Organic substances like humic acid play a significant role in lawn care by promoting the availability of nutrients like phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium and micronutrients. This supports healthier grass growth and root development.

Humic acid also aids in enhancing water retention and soil aeration, fostering better nutrient uptake by grass roots. Its interaction with beneficial microbes contributes to organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling, which promotes a more robust and resilient lawn.

### **The Connection Between Humic Acid and Soil Health**

Healthy soil is the foundation of vibrant lawns. Humic acid promotes soil health by aiding nutrient absorption and supporting essential soil microbes. The acidic properties of humic acid create an environment that supports the growth of beneficial soil microbes, enhancing the soil's ability to sustain healthy plant growth. The impact of humic acid can be observed in the improved soil structure, enhanced water-holding capacity and promotion of micronutrient availability, all of which are essential for healthy and lush lawns.

### **Humic Acid Harvested for Lawn Care Products**

Harvested for lawn care products, humic acid is sourced from [humate](https://www.southlandorganics.com/pages/our-humate-deposit "Humate"). Proper humate sourcing is essential to unlocking the benefits of humic acid, as harvesting humate allows lawn care products to provide essential soil nutrients. The humate source facilitates the uptake of micronutrients, phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium, sulfur and hydrogen by grass roots, promoting overall lawn health and vitality.

### **Our Humate Source**

Our [humic acid products](https://www.southlandorganics.com/collections/homeowners#products "Humic Acid Products") are made from a natural supply of [humic acid material](https://www.southlandorganics.com/pages/our-humate-deposit "Humic Acid Material") found in Coastal Georgia. The deposit is a unique natural blend of organic matter that was deposited in a bowl-shaped depression hundreds of thousands of years ago. Like all humates and humic acids, the resource comes from organic compounds that have been breaking down over eons, creating a carbon-rich vein of humic and fulvic acids.

Lying just below the surface, this deposit has never been compressed as other deposits have. This means that the humic material didn’t harden over the years. Like many of the earth’s mineral resources, humate is found in various qualities. Some very large deposits aren’t the best quality, while others are rich. Our humate deposit is particularly good because of its age—not too young, not too old—and biological makeup.
