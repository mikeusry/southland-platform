As a poultry farmer, you understand the challenges of managing mortality inside the house. The physical strain of carrying heavy buckets of deceased birds, the time spent making multiple trips and the need for efficiency in daily operations all contribute to the demand for a better solution. Enter the [Chicken Reaper](https://harvestpromfg.com/chicken-reaper/ "Chicken Reaper")—a trolley system designed to make handling mortality easier, safer and more efficient.

## Introducing the Chicken Reaper

At the Sunbelt Ag Expo, we had the opportunity to speak with Allen Fisher of [Harvest Pro Mfg](https://harvestpromfg.com/ "Harvest Pro Mfg") at the Georgia Poultry booth. He introduced us to the Chicken Reaper, a practical solution for transporting dead birds out of the house without putting excessive strain on farmers’ backs and knees.

### How It Works

The Chicken Reaper is a trolley system that runs along a 2x6 wood track inside the poultry house. Farmers can choose to run a single line or, for larger mega houses, create a loop for continuous operation.

With a weight capacity of 500 pounds, the system distributes the load evenly across the trusses to ensure durability and safety.

### Additional Uses & Features

Beyond handling mortality, the Chicken Reaper offers versatility for various tasks inside the poultry house:

-   **Ladder Attachment:** A convenient way to move ladders for maintenance work.
-   **Toolbox Hook:** Keep essential tools within reach while working.
-   **Dump Tray Option:** Allows for direct dumping of birds outside, making composting and disposal more efficient.
-   **Remote Control:** Farmers can operate the system remotely, adding convenience and ease of use.

## Why the Chicken Reaper is a Game-Changer

With antibiotic-free poultry production, mortality rates can be higher than before. This makes an efficient removal system even more crucial. The Chicken Reaper helps farmers manage their flocks while reducing physical labor and streamlining operations.
