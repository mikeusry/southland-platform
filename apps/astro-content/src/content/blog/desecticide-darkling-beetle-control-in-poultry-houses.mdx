Darkling beetles in your poultry house are a nuisance, but they're also a biosecurity risk. Our poultry farm pest solution is called [Desecticide](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/darkling-beetle-insecticide "Desecticide Poultry Spray"). It's a non-toxic, non-resistant spray that you can apply with birds present and don't need a license to use. Watch below for more information about Desecticide, how it works and how to use it.

## Desecticide Darkling Beetle Insecticide

At Southland Organics, our motto is "natural solutions to natural problems." Our natural solution to darkling beetles and other pests in poultry houses is [Desecticide](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/darkling-beetle-insecticide "Desecticide Darkling Beetle Insecticide"). It's a responsible, safe and effective spray for killing bugs on poultry farms. 

### All-Natural

Desecticide is all-natural and non-toxic. It contains no harsh chemicals, so it won't harm you, your employees, your pets or anyone who visits your farm. You can spray it with birds present or even spray it on your birds, and they will be unharmed. 

Since Desecticide is non-toxic, you don't need a license to spray it. Anyone can apply Desecticide at any point. 

### Non-Resistant

Since Desecticide is made of oils and soaps, it is non-resistant. That means bugs cannot build resistance to it. It also means that you don't have to worry about rotating pest control products, and there's no limit on the amount of times you can apply it. 

### Contact Kill

Desecticide is a non-residual contact kill spray. So to kill bugs, you need to spray them directly. When you do, the bugs _will_ die!

Desecticide works through its main ingredients of oils and soaps. The oils act as a toxin to the bug, and the soap makes those oils stick so the bugs die. While Desecticide does not provide a residual kill, its smell (which smells good to us humans!) is a deterrent to bugs.

### FIFRA 25B Exempt

You may also like to know that Desecticide is FIFRA 25B exempt. This means the EPA has deemed it GRAS, or "Generally Regarded As Safe." It's recognized as posing little to no threat to the applicator or the environment. 

### Application

To apply, mix 4 gallons of Desecticide with 40 gallons of water to cover 20,000 square feet. When you mix, add the water in first. If you start with Desecticide and then add water, you will get a foam!

### What to Expect

Once you apply Desecticide, you can expect any bugs sprayed to be dead in 24 hours. You can also rest assured that you haven't applied any harmful chemicals on your farm.
