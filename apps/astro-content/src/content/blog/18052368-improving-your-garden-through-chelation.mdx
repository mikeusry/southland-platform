## What is chelation?

Wikipedia states:

> 1.  A **chelating agent** is a substance whose molecules can form several bonds to a single metal ion. In other words, a **chelating agent** is a multidentate ligand. An example of a simple **chelating agent** is ethylenediamine.
>     

That is a bit of a mouthful and certainly not in layman's terms. Matt is going to break it down a bit differently. Since we deal with agriculture, we will relate the definition like this:

> Chelation is a process by which a material is bound and the charge is changed to make it attractive OR unattractive to the plant root.
