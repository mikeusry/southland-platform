It's time to start planning your fall/winter harvest. We are in the next phase of planting (mid July–September), and we have organized a list of over 20+ vegetables to help you make the planning a little easier.

Make sure to plant the following vegetables no later than July 20th to allow time to mature before your first frost. Georgia falls under zone 8A, but make sure to check your USDA hardiness zone to find the best crops to plant. Most of these vegetables can be planted or sown directly outdoors to ensure that your winter vegetable garden is fully stocked.
