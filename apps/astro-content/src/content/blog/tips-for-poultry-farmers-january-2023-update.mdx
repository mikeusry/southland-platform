Allen is back with 3 new tips for poultry farmers! Check out the video below for our 2023 edition of Poultry Biosecurity Tips and Tricks.

## 1\. Protect Your Dogs From Pests

We love our dogs! But they can be vectors for pests like chicken mites, which can carry diseases. Bringing your dog around your farm can in turn bring pests around your farm.

The tip here is simply to treat your dogs for fleas, ticks and other pests! We know that treating dogs for fleas should be handled carefully, and there's not one option that works for every dog. We understand there are some unsafe options out there too! But we recommend picking one of the safe options so you can prevent your dog from carrying pests into your poultry houses.

## 2\. Install a Bin Lever

This is a neat feature we saw on a friend's farm. If you install a lever on your feed bin, you can better control the flow of feed from your bin door. You can even add one on the bend of the auger! 

## 3\. Add a Sink and Hose in your Control Room

Another cool tip we found on a customer's farm. This farmer installed a sink in their control room, which has got to be super convenient. He also has a hose hanging up right next to it. This can be used to rinse off just about anything in or out of the sink. Installing a sink or hose could take your control room to the next level!
