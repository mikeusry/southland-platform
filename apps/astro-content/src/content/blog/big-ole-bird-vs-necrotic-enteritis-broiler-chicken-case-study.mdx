Southland Organics is proud to release the results of a case study involving the product [Big Ole Bird](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/poultry-probiotic), or BOB, which also means Biology Optimized for Birds. This product aims to improve gut microflora, while simultaneously introducing rich organic acids to the formula as well as activated carbon. Big Ole Bird is a highly concentrated formula with the ability to provide poultry with the protection they need through probiotics.

## The Study

The case study was performed by Southern Poultry Research using Cobb-Vantress broiler chickens (Cobb 500). The goal of the case study was to investigate Big Ole Bird’s effectiveness in reducing or eliminating the effects of Enteritis caused by Clostridium.

The male chickens used in the study were obtained from Cobb-Vantress in Cleveland, GA. They received routine vaccinations and only healthy chicks were kept for the case study. Upon arrival to their cages, the chicks were separated into three groups: the Control Group, the Infected Control Group and the Study Group.

The Control Group received no water additive and were not challenged with Clostridium. The Infected Control Group received no water additive and were challenged with Clostridium broth. The Study Group were challenged with clostridium and received Big Ole Bird probiotic water treatment. The chicks challenged with Clostridium were given the Clostridium broth for three days (Days 19, 20, & 21), which included the Infected Control Group and the Study Group.

Besides the groups’ differences in Clostridium infection and water additive, they were provided a variety of controlled variables. Each group received identical housing in facilities checked thoroughly to assure all cages were supplied with water and feed. The temperature was also regulated and continuous light by fluorescent lamps illuminated the area. All three groups were also challenged with Coccidial oocyst at Day 14.

## Results

The Infected Control Group was negatively affected based on feed intake, feed conversion, and weight gain. However, the end results were favorable for the Study Group of chickens provided Big Ole Bird probiotic water treatment. These chickens challenged with Clostridium and supplied with Big Ole Bird probiotic water treatment showed a 0.8% decline in feed intake, 7.1% improvement in feed conversion and a 6.7% improvement in weight gain over the Infected Control Group.

Lesion development showed no statistical difference between Big Ole Bird water treatment study group and the infected control group. In addition to these favorable results for the Big Ole Bird probiotic water treatment, the mortality was improved by 6.2% over the Infected Control Group. 

## Conclusion

The conclusion of the study proves that [Big Ole Bird](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/poultry-probiotic) provides lower mortality, better feed conversion and greater weight gain when challenged with Enteritis.

Big Ole Bird treated birds had a better feed conversion rate and lower mortality than infected birds without treatment. Thus the water treatment did reduce the pathogenic effects from Necrotic Enteritis.
