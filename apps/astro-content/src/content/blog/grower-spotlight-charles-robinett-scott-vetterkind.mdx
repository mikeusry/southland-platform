What an honor it was to sit down with two former Marines who spent over 20 years protecting our freedoms. Now they serve our country in a different way but still have the same fight and determination. Charles and Scott share with me their journey from retirement to starting their own poultry farm. The lessons they've learned in the military have shaped how they face and overcome the current challenges of working in the commercial poultry industry. We are grateful for their service and think you'll be encouraged by this spotlight.
