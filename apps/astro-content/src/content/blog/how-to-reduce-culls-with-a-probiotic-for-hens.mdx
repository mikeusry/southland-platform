Hen Helper improves overall health, egg quality and nutrition in breeder and layer hens. Probiotics and organic acids—key ingredients in Hen Helper—work together to increase egg production and quality in hens.

## What is Hen Helper?

Maybe you're seeing dirty eggs because your birds have loose diarrhea and feed passage issues. Or maybe you're seeing poor shell quality because your birds are having problems with calcium absorption. What can you do to prevent both of these issues and more? Give your hens a probiotic called [Hen Helper](https://www.southlandorganics.com/collections/poultry-breeders/products/hen-helper?variant=15018147512418 "Hen Helper Probiotics and Electrolytes for Chickens")!

Just like our [Big Ole Bird](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/poultry-probiotic "Big Ole Bird Poultry Probiotic"), Hen Helper also deals with mortality, disease issues and building the immune system.

### High Carbon Count

The carbon baseline for Hen Helper binds harmful compounds and boosts overall health. Carbon plays a significant role in a chicken's digestive health. You can go to your local vitamin or health shop and look in the digestion section, and you'll see activated charcoal for digestion. That's basically carbon! And just like it helps humans have a healthy digestive system, it helps a chicken's digestive system too.

### Fulvic Acid

The organic acid in Hen Helper is called [fulvic acid](https://www.southlandorganics.com/blogs/poultry-biosecurity/our-secret-ingredient-fulvic-acid-liquid "Fulvic Acid"). Fulvic acid helps improve shell quality and egg production by keeping hens in peak longer. Fulvic acid also helps the bird absorb nutrients on a cellular level. It helps the cells to be more permeable, so they can take in nutrients and get rid of waste.

### Beneficial Bacteria

Our chicken probiotics contain 14 strains of beneficial bacteria that help prevent disease. One of the beneficial microorganisms is _Bacillus subtilis,_ which eliminates bad bacteria with good bacteria through [competitive exclusion](https://www.southlandorganics.com/blogs/poultry-biosecurity/115524548-poultry-farming-battling-poultry-disease-the-proper-way "Competitive Exclusion"). It also improves feed conversion by optimizing intestinal health in the digestive tract.

## Health Benefits of Hen Helper

![Healthy chickens](https://res.cloudinary.com/southland-organics/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1707847429/Blog%20Images/Healthy_chickens_r0j2dr.png)

Beneficial for both baby chicks and adult chickens, Hen Helper produces cleaner eggs and firmer shells, improves nutrient absorption and increases peak performance.

### Produces Cleaner Eggs and Firmer Shells

As an egg producer, one of your biggest concerns is likely culls from dirty eggs. Hen Helper can help with this! When you're giving your birds probiotic supplements like Hen Helper, firm manure with white caps is one of the first things you should see. This helps keep your eggs cleaner because it's helping the bird's digestion.

For a broiler, they love it because it helps turn feed into weight because they're getting the nutrients out of the feed. So when you're not passing feed and dirtying the eggs, you have better shell quality.

### Improves Nutrient Absorption

As far as nutrient absorption goes, Hen Helper helps achieve better calcium absorption. That's why many people comment on how it helps with firmer eggs. Better shell quality, better eggs. Fewer culls, more profits.

### Increases Peak Performance

For a lot of egg producers, keeping birds in peak is a big deal. If you can keep your birds healthy, help them with nutrient absorption and build their immune system, then staying in peak or even getting into peak a little earlier can happen too.

Run 4 ounces of Hen Helper per gallon of stock solution in a medicator pump set at 1:128.

Start using Hen Helper upon arrival. Run for 72 hours on the initial dose. After the initial dose, run one 24-hour period per week.

This recommendation is for cost effectiveness, however many customers run Hen Helper more often to maximize its effects and benefits. Due to the nature of Hen Helper, you cannot over apply.

If you're also using our [Mother Load](https://www.southlandorganics.com/products/apple-cider-vinegar-for-chickens "Mother Load Apple Cider Vinegar for Chickens"), apple cider vinegar with garlic, leave three days between running the products.

_For backyard chicken keepers, pour ½ oz of Hen Helper per 3 gallons (or 1 tsp per gallon) of plain drinking water in your coop waterers._
