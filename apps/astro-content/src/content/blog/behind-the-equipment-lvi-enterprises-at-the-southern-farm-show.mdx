At the Southern Farm Show in Raleigh, we spoke with Jay Zimmerman of LVI Enterprises to learn more about their equipment offerings for poultry litter management. LVI specializes in tools that help growers process and prepare poultry litter between flocks.

## About LVI Enterprises

[LVI Enterprises](http://lvimfg.com "LVI Enterprises") focuses on poultry litter management equipment. Their product line includes pulverizers, windrowers, litter levelers and barn blowers. The equipment is designed to help growers recycle litter after bird removal and prepare houses for the next flock.

## Windrower Features

We spoke in front of LVI’s deluxe windrower model, which Jay described as their flagship piece. Key features include:

-   **Dual hydraulic cylinders:** One levels the unit as it moves across the floor, and another allows for side shifting, enabling better maneuvering around feed and water lines or closer access to barn walls.
    
-   **Wall-following wing with a flex wheel:** This attachment allows the machine to follow the wall contour while avoiding damage, pulling litter away from edges without scraping the structure.
    
-   **Rotor with 34 notched paddles:** The windrower includes more paddles than many other models, which helps break down litter into a finer consistency. This finer material helps create tighter windrows and promotes faster composting by releasing moisture more efficiently.
    
-   **Heavy-duty construction:** It is designed for durability and long-term use in poultry operations.
    

## Additional Equipment

In addition to windrowers, LVI offers:

-   Litter levelers for evening out the surface after processing
    
-   Blowers to remove dust and clean barns before restocking
