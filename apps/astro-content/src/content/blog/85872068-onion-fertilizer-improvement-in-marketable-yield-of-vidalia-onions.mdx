It has been a few years, but the results of this particular study have been realized again and again on other onion stands. A few years back, we conducted a study to see if improvement in marketable yield could be achieved through the application of our [humic acid](/products/compost-tea "Compost Tea") and fertilizer combinations on test plots of “Georgia Boy” onions. The test was conducted on unequal size plots Southwest of Statesboro, GA.

What we found was not noticeable to us at first. Sure, we enjoy onions and love those sweet Vidalias, and we had to learn what a marketable yield meant and how onion size plays a big part in that.

## Conclusion & Recommendations

The results of the study prove the anecdotal results that have been provided by customers. The combination of liquid Ultimate Tea and a fertilizer program show great improvement in regards to marketable yield and increased bulb size. Keeping in mind that this was a few years ago before our development of Liquid Fish Hydrolysate and our involvement with the FertALive program.

Based on this study and our current developments, our recommended application for Onion Fertilizer:

-   Apply GreenMine in late fall at a rate of 200 lbs per acre
-   Apply Jump Start Soil Conditioner at a rate of 2 gallons per acre 1 month prior to planting
-   Apply Liquid Fish Hydrolysate twice times during the grow-out

-   Space fertilization applications 30 days apart
-   Apply at a rate of 3 gallons per acre diluted 1:25 ratio

-   Apply Ultimate Tea at a rate of 1 gallon per acre every 45 days post-planting

We feel that this application rate will continue to provide a great improvement in onion size and marketable product.
