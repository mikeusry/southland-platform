Christmas is here, and we at Southland Organics wanted to not only wish you a Merry Christmas but take a moment to reflect on the true meaning of Christmas. 

‍Check out the video below:

There are many things that distract us during this time. Besides the fact that the birds don’t know it's Christmas, gifts, parties, family visits and the pressure of the pandemic consume our minds as life plows ahead.

The real Christmas story doesn’t start in Luke chapter 2.  It actually starts in Isaiah when the prophet foretold the birth of our Savior.  For thousands of years, the world has strived for both personal and cultural peace. We’ve had great examples of that in the past year.  

True peace is found only in Jesus, the Prince of Peace, who was born that Christmas morning. Just as those before Him looked forward to His birth, we look back to that moment, as the one that changed the world.  

As a farmer, you can relate a little more to this event than other people. I enjoy seeing many of your Facebook posts on various groups, especially when you post new additions to your family. However, I’ve yet to see any of you give birth down at the chicken house.

But this is pretty much how it went down. I don’t know what the ammonia was like or the smell, but I’m sure the ventilation wasn't good. Why the dirty stable, why no fanfare? This was the King of Kings. The Prince of Peace.  

The book of Philippians says that He made himself of no reputation, took on the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of man. Just as it is today so it was back then, there was no room for Him.  

As a man, I have an easier time relating to Joseph in this story, more so than Mary. Trying to provide comfort for his wife and a place for the Son of God to be born into this world. How inadequate he must have felt.   

Without cell phones, internet, cars or planes, Christ’s birth was anticipated and dignitaries from other countries came to worship Him. Even the government knew something was happening. Caesar was so threatened by the news of this king that he sent agents to kill the newborn. 

Joseph did what he could and provided a feed trough for the new king to be laid.  What a strange way to save the world.

Fast forward 33 years later and we see the purpose for this sequence of events.  After a sinless life of nothing but ministering to people, the world rejected him as a king. His life ended through a cruel death meant for the worst criminals. Second Corinthians says he was made to be sin for us, He who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

Another Joseph enters the story. He was a very wealthy man preparing a royal grave, one that he would give the King of Kings, crucified on a criminal’s cross. What a strange way to save the world.

It didn’t end there. Three days later, the King rose in victory to give us hope not only in this life but in the life to come. And because of His sacrifice, it is simply ours for the asking.

As always, if you have any questions or want to talk more about this video, nothing would please me more. So this Christmas, don’t lose sight of its purpose.  No matter what has happened this year you can have hope, peace and everlasting life. 

From all of us at Southland Organics, we care about you and we hope you have a very Merry Christmas.
