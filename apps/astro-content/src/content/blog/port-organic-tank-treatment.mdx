Human waste is a natural problem, and we at Southland Organics want to provide a natural solution. Check out this video to learn about [PORT](https://www.southlandorganics.com/collections/waste/products/holding-tank-treatment "PORT Holding Tank Treatment"), our organic tank treatment that uses carbon, oxygen and beneficial microbes to accelerate the natural breakdown process in outdoor toilets. PORT can even break down non-biodegradable compounds, meaning less solid waste when it's time for you to pump. For your visitors, it means eliminating odors so they can focus on enjoying your facility. All you have to do is pour PORT in the [vault](https://www.southlandorganics.com/blogs/news/17989164-vault-toilets-a-step-up-from-the-pit "Vault Toilet Meaning: A Step Up from the Pit") once between pumps. National parks, US forests and Bureau of Land Management facilities use this holding tank treatment to promote the natural composting process in their outdoor toilets. Choose an all-natural product like PORT to protect what we love most: the great outdoors.
