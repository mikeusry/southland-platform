Runt and Stunt has got to be one of the best names for a disease. But then again, Kinky Back is a pretty good one too.  

Runt and Stunt is also known as Malabsorption Syndrome. Just like many of the issues we talk about, a lot of it boils down to nutrient absorption. This challenge actually prevents nutrient absorption, so the problem is compounded. Nutrient absorption is what is needed to help the bird fight the “virus/disease,” but the virus prevents nutrient absorption. The symptoms and mortality commonly peak about day 11, so this is an issue that typically affects young birds.
